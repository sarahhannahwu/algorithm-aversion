## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
DK <- read_csv("Data_DK.csv") %>% 
  select(Trust_human, Trust_AI, Uniqueness_Human, Uniquenesss_AI)
FR <- read_csv("Data_FR.csv") %>% 
  select(Trust_human, Trust_AI, Uniqueness_Human, Uniquenesss_AI)

both_countries <- bind_rows(DK, FR)

# Summary stats
summary_stats <- both_countries %>% 
  summarize(mean_trust_human = mean(Trust_human, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_trust_human = sd(Trust_human, na.rm = TRUE),
            n_human = n(),
            mean_trust_AI = mean(Trust_AI, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_trust_AI = sd(Trust_AI, na.rm = TRUE))

# For some reason this gives 1168 rows, whereas in the paper there are 1068
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
