ID-001,article,Humans as creativity gatekeepers: Are we biased against AI creativity?,"With artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly involved in the creation of organizational and commercial artifacts, human evaluators’ role as creativity gatekeepers of AI-produced artifacts will become critical for innovation processes. However, when humans evaluate creativity, their judgment is clouded by biases triggered by the characteristics of the creator. Drawing from folk psychology and algorithm aversion research, we examine whether the identity of the producer of a given artifact as artificial intelligence (AI) or human is a source of bias affecting people’s creativity evaluation of such artifact and what drives this effect. With four experimental studies (n = 2039), of which two were pre-registered, using different experimental designs and evaluation targets, we found that people sometimes—but not always—ascribe lower creativity to a product when they are told that the producer is an AI rather than a human. In addition, we found that people consistently perceive generative AI to exert less effort than humans in the creation of a given artifact, which drives the lower creativity ratings ascribed to generative AI producers. We discuss the implication of these findings for organizational creativity and innovation in the context of human-AI interaction.

ID-002,article,Overcome medical algorithm aversion: Conditional joint effect of direct and indirect information,"The just-ended COVID-19 pandemic and the looming global aging remind us that we need to be prepared for the shortage of doctors, which might become an urgent medical crisis in the future. Medical AI could relieve this urgency and sometimes perform better than human doctors; however, people are reluctant to trust medical AI because of algorithm aversion. Although several factors that can minimize algorithm aversion have been identified, they are not effective enough to promote medical AI as people’s first choice. Therefore, inspired by the direct and indirect information model of trust and media equation hypothesis, this research explored a new method to minimize aversion to medical AI by highlighting its social attributes. In 3 between-subject studies, a medical AI system’s direct information (i.e., transparency and quantitation of the decision-making process (DMP)) and indirect information (i.e., social proof) were manipulated. Study 1 (N = 193) and 2 (N = 429) showed that transparency of DMP and social proof increased trust in AI, but did not affect trust in human doctors. Social proof jointly affected trust in AI with non-quantitative DMP but not quantitative DMP. Study 3 (N = 184) further revealed the joint effect of the transparent non-quantitative DMP and near-perfect social proof, which could minimize algorithm aversion. These results extended the direct-indirect information model in interpersonal trust, revealed conditional media equation in human-AI trust, and offered practical implications for medical AI interface design.

ID-003,article,Perceived corruption reduces algorithm aversion,"Scholarship on when and why humans are willing to rely on algorithms rather than other humans has made substantial progress in recent years, although virtually all such research is based on Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) research participants. This limits efforts to understand the cultural generalizability of attitudes toward algorithms. In this paper, I study algorithm aversion among participants from over 30 countries on all inhabited continents, thereby significantly increasing the diversity of this field's knowledge base. Furthermore, I leverage this diversity to test a theoretically derived prediction: that perceived corruption makes algorithmic decision‐making more appealing. I find that participants who are born or raised in countries with high levels of perceived corruption are much less averse to algorithmic decision‐making (or, in some studies, are not at all algorithm averse), relative to those from countries with low perceived corruption. Furthermore, experimentally varying corruption salience causes a decrease in algorithm aversion. I explore mechanisms and boundary conditions of these effects and discuss the implications in the context of algorithms that can both increase and decrease injustice.

ID-004,article,On the (non-) reliance on algorithms—A decision-theoretic account,"A wealth of empirical evidence shows that people display opposite behaviors when deciding whether to rely on an algorithm, even if it is inexpensive to do so and using the algorithm should enhance their own performance. This paper develops a formal theory to explain some of these conflicting facts and submit new testable predictions. Drawing from decision analysis, I invoke two key notions: the ‘value of information’ and the ‘value of control’. The value of information matters to users of algorithms like recommender systems and prediction machines, which essentially provide information. I find that ambiguity aversion or a subjective cost of employing an algorithm will tend to decrease the value of algorithmic information, while repeated exposure to an algorithm might not always increase this value. The value of control matters to users who may delegate decision making to an algorithm. I model how, under partial delegation, imperfect understanding of what the algorithm actually does (so the algorithm is in fact a black box) can cause algorithm aversion. Some possible remedies are formulated and discussed.

ID-005,article,Social trust and algorithmic equity: The societal perspectives of users' intention to interact with algorithm recommendation systems,"The use of algorithm recommendation systems (ARS), which collect and analyze users' personal data to generate personalized and tailored recommended items, has become widespread in the era of mobile internet. While related literature has focused on privacy issues and trust toward ARS or recommended items, societal aspects such as social trust (toward people and organizations responsible for an algorithm) and algorithmic equity have been overlooked. Drawing on the theory of social trust, we investigate the psychological mechanism between social trust and users' intention to interact with ARS (e.g., click recommended items and continuously use). Based on a survey of young mobile internet users in China, we show that, first, social trust is positively associated with perceived benefits and perceived algorithmic equity, which are further linked to intention to click recommended items and intention to continuously use ARS (i.e., continuance intention). Second, social trust is negatively related to perceived risks, in turn reducing intention to click. Further, algorithm aversion weakens the negative association between social trust and perceived risk. Our study contributes to the ARS literature from the societal aspect, by validating the importance of social trust, demonstrating the key role of perceived algorithmic equity, and examining the trait of algorithm aversion as a moderator in the formation of algorithm-related perceptions. We also offer key practical suggestions for app developers and policymakers, related to algorithmic equity, transparency, and privacy risk of ARS management and regulation.

ID-006,article,Conservatives endorse Fintech? Individual regulatory focus attenuates the algorithm aversion effects in automated wealth management,"Algorithm aversion, which is a widely observed phenomenon, suggests that customers prefer human advisors over robo-advisors in automated wealth management. Studies have shown that prevention-focused (vs. promotion-focused) customers refuse high-tech products; therefore, algorithm aversion should be more pronounced among them. However, our findings challenge this notion. Drawing on the regulatory focus theory, through four studies, we discovered that (1) customers' mindset was relatively more prevention-focused when using robo-advisors and relatively more promotion-focused when using human advisors; (2) perceived flexibility mediated this effect; and (3) the algorithm aversion effects existed in automated wealth management, but vanished among prevention-focused customers because of the fit effects. Our findings identified a psychological boundary condition of algorithm aversion, provided a novel antecedent variable of regulatory focus, and provided managerial implications for robo-advisory firms’ market segmentation strategies.

ID-007,article,How to overcome algorithm aversion: Learning from mistakes,"When consumers avoid taking algorithmic advice, it can prove costly to both marketers (whose algorithmic product offerings go unused) and to themselves (who fail to reap the benefits that algorithmic predictions often provide). In a departure from previous research focusing on when algorithm aversion proves more or less likely, we sought to identify and remedy one reason why it occurs in the first place. In seven pre-registered studies, we find that consumers tend to avoid algorithmic advice on the often faulty assumption that those algorithms, unlike their human counterparts, cannot learn from mistakes, in turn offering an inroad by which to reduce algorithm aversion: highlighting their ability to learn. Process evidence, through both mediation and moderation, examines why consumers fail to trust algorithms that err across a variety of prediction domains and how different theory-driven interventions can solve the practical problem of enhancing trust and consequential choice in algorithms.",https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/how-overcome-algorithm-aversion-learning-mistakes/docview/2685599736/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=How+to+overcome+algorithm+aversion%3A+Learning+from+mistakes&title=Journal+of+Consumer+Psychology&issn=10577408&date=2023-04-01&volume=33&issue=2&spage=285&au=Reich%2C+Taly%3BKaju%2C+Alex%3BMaglio%2C+Sam+J.&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+Consumer+Psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2022-79864-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fjcpy.1313,1,1,1,marketing,ability to learn,,,Taly Reich and Alex Kaju and Sam J Maglio,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcpy.1313,"1057-7408, 1057-7408",2,Journal of Consumer Psychology,"3900:Consumer Psychology,Adulthood (18 yrs & older),Algorithms,Aversion,Consumer Behavior,Consumer Psychology,Empirical Study,Errors,Female,Human,Learning,Male,Marketing,Prediction,Quantitative Study,algorithm appreciation,algorithm aversion,article,intervention,learning from mistakes,mistakes",4,"Copyright - © 2022, Society for Consumer Psychology",285-302,2685599736; 2022-79864-001,Wiley-Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ID-008,article,The extent of algorithm aversion in decision-making situations with varying gravity,"Algorithms already carry out many tasks more reliably than human experts. Nevertheless, some subjects have an aversion towards algorithms. In some decision-making situations an error can have serious consequences, in others not. In the context of a framing experiment, we examine the connection between the consequences of a decision-making situation and the frequency of algorithm aversion. This shows that the more serious the consequences of a decision are, the more frequently algorithm aversion occurs. Particularly in the case of very important decisions, algorithm aversion thus leads to a reduction of the probability of success. This can be described as the tragedy of algorithm aversion.

ID-009,article,When algorithms err: Differential impact of early vs. late errors on users’ reliance on algorithms,"Errors are a natural part of predictive algorithms, but may discourage users from relying on algorithms. We conduct two experiments to demonstrate that reliance on a predictive algorithm following a substantial error is affected by (i) when the error occurs and (ii) how the algorithm is used in the decision-making process. We find that the impact of an error on reliance depends on whether the error occurs early (i.e., when users first start using the algorithm) or late (i.e., after users have used the algorithm for an extended period). While an early error results in substantial and persistent reliance reduction, a late error affects reliance only temporarily and to a lesser extent. However, when users have more control over how to use the algorithm’s predictions, error timing ceases to have a significant impact. Our work advances the understanding of algorithm aversion and informs the practical design of algorithmic decision-making systems.",https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/i-when-algorithms-err-differential-impact-early/docview/2886383689/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=When+algorithms+err%3A+Differential+impact+of+early+vs.+late+errors+on+users%26rsquo%3B+reliance+on+algorithms&title=ACM+Transactions+on+Computer-Human+Interaction&issn=10730516&date=2023-02-01&volume=30&issue=1&spage=1&au=Kim%2C+Antino%3BYang%2C+Mochen%3BZhang%2C+Jingjing&isbn=&jtitle=ACM+Transactions+on+Computer-Human+Interaction&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2023-93508-014&rft_id=info:doi/10.1145%2F3557889,1,1,1,"prediction (using fictitious example of predicting crop yield based on rainfall, fertilizer)",,,Ps choose between their own prediction vs. the algorithm's prediction.

ID-010,article,Algorithmic transference: People overgeneralize failures of AI in the government,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is pervading the government and transforming how public services are provided to consumers across policy areas spanning allocation of government benefits, law enforcement, risk monitoring, and the provision of services. Despite technological improvements, AI systems are fallible and may err. How do consumers respond when learning of AI failures? In 13 preregistered studies (N = 3,724) across a range of policy areas, the authors show that algorithmic failures are generalized more broadly than human failures. This effect is termed “algorithmic transference” as it is an inferential process that generalizes (i.e., transfers) information about one member of a group to another member of that same group. Rather than reflecting generalized algorithm aversion, algorithmic transference is rooted in social categorization: it stems from how people perceive a group of AI systems versus a group of humans. Because AI systems are perceived as more homogeneous than people, failure information about one AI algorithm is transferred to another algorithm to a greater extent than failure information about a person is transferred to another person. Capturing AI's impact on consumers and societies, these results show how the premature or mismanaged deployment of faulty AI technologies may undermine the very institutions that AI systems are meant to modernize.

ID-012,article,The effect of past algorithmic performance and decision significance on algorithmic advice acceptance,"This study aimed to investigate people’s willingness to accept algorithmic over human advice, under varying conditions of previous algorithmic performance and decision significance. We randomly presented hypothetical scenarios to 218 participants. Scenarios differed in relation to decision context (i.e., choices relating to taxi-routes, movies, restaurants, medical interventions, savings strategies, and bush fire evacuation), and within each scenario past algorithmic performance was also varied (equal, above average, or far greater than the human expert). Participants were asked to rate decision significance, and their likelihood of choosing the algorithmic advice over the human expert. Based on participants’ perceived decision significance, scenarios were classified as either low- or high-stakes. We tested for differences in participants’ ratings of algorithmic acceptance across levels of past performance and decision significance. Results revealed that as past accuracy and decision significance increased, the likelihood of algorithmic advice adoption also increased. An interaction between past accuracy and decision significance indicated increased algorithmic advice acceptance under conditions of far greater previous performance, in high-, compared to low-stakes scenarios. These findings are contrary to a large body of past research wherein people’s algorithm aversion persisted despite superior algorithmic performance and have implications to human-algorithm interaction and system design.

ID-013,article,Trust in public policy algorithms,"Algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in many areas of public policy. Yet, we know surprisingly little about the degree of trust individuals are willing to place in these algorithms. This article reports on a series of experiments on trust in algorithms for forecasting political events and criminal recidivism. Contrary to previous literature on algorithm aversion, we find that people show high levels of trust in algorithms relative to other sources of advice, even with minimal information about the algorithm. We also explore evaluation of combined human and algorithm advice. We find that, when experts make decisions in light of algorithm advice, the relative weight given to their judgments increases, but the algorithm’s guidance is not disregarded. Finally, using a conjoint experiment, we evaluate the factors that influence people’s preferences for algorithms, finding that risk aversion, data size, human in the loop, and developer reputation play an important role in engendering trust.

ID-014,article,"Effect of having, but not consulting, a computerized diagnostic aid","Previous research has described physicians’ reluctance to use computerized diagnostic aids (CDAs) but has never experimentally examined the effects of not consulting an aid that was readily available. Experiment 1. Participants read about a diagnosis made either by a physician or an auto mechanic (to control for perceived expertise). Half read that a CDA was available but never actually consulted; no mention of a CDA was made for the remaining half. For the physician, failure to consult the CDA had no significant effect on competence ratings for either the positive or negative outcome. For the auto mechanic, failure to consult the CDA actually increased competence ratings following a negative but not a positive outcome. Negligence judgments were greater for the mechanic than for the physician overall. Experiment 2. Using only a negative outcome, we included 2 different reasons for not consulting the aid and provided accuracy information highlighting the superiority of the CDA over the physician. In neither condition was the physician rated lower than when no aid was mentioned. Ratings were lower when the physician did not trust the CDA and, surprisingly, higher when the physician believed he or she already knew what the CDA would say. Finally, consistent with our previous research, ratings were also high when the physician consulted and then followed the advice of a CDA and low when the CDA was consulted but ignored. Individual differences in numeracy did not qualify these results.

ID-015,article,"To err is human, not algorithmic—Robust reactions to erring algorithms","When seeing algorithms err, we trust them less and decrease using them compared to after seeing humans err; this is called algorithm aversion. This paper builds on the algorithm aversion literature and the third-party reactions to mistreatment model to investigate a wider array of reactions to erring algorithms. Using an experimental design deployed with a vignette-based online study, we investigate gut reactions, justice cognitions, and behavioral intentions toward erring algorithms (compared to erring humans). Our results show that when the error was committed by an algorithm (vs. a human), gut reactions were harsher (i.e., less acceptance and more negative feelings), justice cognitions weaker (i.e., less blame, less forgiveness, and less accountability), and behavioral intentions stronger.

ID-016,article,How information processing style shapes people’s algorithm adoption,"Across four studies I tested why people are averse to relying on algorithmic judgments in person judgment tasks (e.g., student admissions), and examined how such aversions can be attenuated. I proposed that people tend to focus more on case-specific information (vs. general propositions) in person-judgment tasks, and that algorithms (vs. human experts) are believed to be skilled at addressing general propositions (vs. case-specific information). Thus, I posited that in person-judgment tasks, people would be less averse to relying on algorithmic judgments when they focus more on general propositions (vs. case-specific information). By varying the perceived importance of case-specific information and general propositions, the research provides support for these hypotheses. In addition, the results reveal the mechanism underlying algorithm aversion in person judgments and provide a cost-effective way to increase consumers’ algorithm adoption.

ID-017,article,Robo-investment aversion,"In five experiments (n = 3,828), we investigate whether people prefer investment decisions to be made by human investment managers rather than by algorithms (“robos”). In all of the studies we investigate morally controversial companies, as it is plausible that a preference for humans as investment managers becomes exacerbated in areas where machines are less competent, such as morality. In Study 1, participants rated the permissibility of an algorithm to autonomously exclude morally controversial stocks from investment portfolios as lower than if a human fund manager did the same; this finding was not different if participants were informed that such exclusions might be financially disadvantageous for them. In Study 2, we show that this robo-investment aversion manifests itself both when considering investment in controversial and non-controversial industries. In Study 3, our findings show that robo-investment aversion is also present when algorithms are given the autonomy to increase investment in controversial stocks. In Studies 4 and 5, we investigate choices between actual humans and an algorithm. In Study 4 –which was incentivized–participants show no robo-investment aversion, but are significantly less likely to choose machines as investment managers for controversial stocks. In contrast, in Study 5 robo-investment aversion is present, but it is not different across controversial and non-controversial stocks. Overall, our findings show a considerable mean effect size for robo-investment aversion.",https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/robo-investment-aversion/docview/2493142783/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Robo-investment+aversion&title=PLoS+ONE&issn=1932-6203&date=2020-09-17&volume=15&issue=9&spage=&au=Niszczota%2C+Pawe%C5%82%3BKasz%C3%A1s%2C+D%C3%A1niel&isbn=&jtitle=PLoS+ONE&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2021-10482-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0239277,1,1,1,finance,,,,Paweł Niszczota and Dániel Kaszás,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239277,,9,PLoS ONE,"3600:Organizational Psychology & Human Resources,Adulthood (18 yrs & older),Algorithms,Attitude to Computers,Autonomy,Aversion,Business Investments,Business Organizations,Economics, Behavioral,Empirical Study,Female,Human,Humans,Investments,Male,Management Personnel,Morality,Preferences,Quantitative Study,Robo-investment,Robotics,Switzerland,article,aversion,non-controversial stocks",9,"Copyright - © 2020, Niszczota, Kaszás.

ID-018,article,Algorithm aversion is too often presented as though it were non-compensatory: A reply to Longoni et al. (2020),"We clarify two points made in our commentary (Pezzo & Beckstead, 2020, this issue) (see record 2020-40390-011) on a recent paper by Longoni, Bonezzi, and Morewedge (2019). In both Experiments 1 and 4 from their paper, it is not possible to determine whether accuracy can compensate for algorithm aversion. Experiments 3A-C, however, do show a strong effect of accuracy such that AI that is superior to a human provider is embraced by patients. Many papers, including Longoni et al. tend to minimize the role of this compensatory process, apparently because it seems obvious to the authors (Longoni, Bonezzi, Morewedge, 2020, this issue) (see record 2020-40390-012). Such minimization, however, can lead to (mis)citations in which research that clearly demonstrates a compensatory role of AI accuracy is cited as non-compensatory.

ID-019,article,Resistance to medical artificial intelligence is an attribute in a compensatory decision process: Response to Pezzo and Becksted (2020),"In Longoni et al. (2019), we examine how algorithm aversion influences utilization of healthcare delivered by human and artificial intelligence providers. Pezzo and Beckstead’s commentary (see record 2020-40390-011) asks whether resistance to medical AI takes the form of a noncompensatory decision strategy, in which a single attribute determines provider choice, or whether resistance to medical AI is one of several attributes considered in a compensatory decision strategy. We clarify that our paper both claims and finds that, all else equal, resistance to medical AI is one of several attributes (e.g., cost and performance) influencing healthcare utilization decisions. In other words, resistance to medical AI is a consequential input to compensatory decisions regarding healthcare utilization and provider choice decisions, not a noncompensatory decision strategy. People do not always reject healthcare provided by AI, and our article makes no claim that they do.

ID-020,article,Is optimal recommendation the best? A laboratory investigation under the newsvendor problem,"We investigate the impacts of the decision support system's recommendations on decision makers' psychology and decision behaviors under uncertain contexts where optimal solutions exist. As a representative of such contexts, the newsvendor problem is studied by using the method of laboratory experiments. Through providing an elaborately designed decision support system in Experiment I, we validate that the optimal recommendations help to alleviate human newsvendors' Pull-to-Center bias, i.e., the actual orders fall in the range between mean demand and optimal order that maximizes the expected profit theoretically, and decrease the bias asymmetry under two profit conditions (high or low). We also reveal that optimal recommendations can't eliminate the bias, as decision makers exhibit two competing psychological factors simultaneously when using the decision support system: algorithm aversion and regret aversion. Algorithm aversion persistently impedes them from following the superior recommendations, while regret aversion sometimes pulls them to approach to the recommendations driven by the feeling of experienced regret. Further, we redesign the decision support system in Experiment II and find that, although the conservative system recommendations are valueless compared with the optimal one, the well-designed radical system recommendations may eliminate the Pull-to-Center bias under the high-profit condition, through the interaction of the dominant regret aversion, dominated algorithm aversion, and the anchoring effect.

ID-021,article,A systematic review of algorithm aversion in augmented decision making,"Despite abundant literature theorizing societal implications of algorithmic decision making, relatively little is known about the conditions that lead to the acceptance or rejection of algorithmically generated insights by individual users of decision aids. More specifically, recent findings of algorithm aversion—the reluctance of human forecasters to use superior but imperfect algorithms—raise questions about whether joint human‐algorithm decision making is feasible in practice. In this paper, we systematically review the topic of algorithm aversion as it appears in 61 peer‐reviewed articles between 1950 and 2018 and follow its conceptual trail across disciplines. We categorize and report on the proposed causes and solutions of algorithm aversion in five themes: expectations and expertise, decision autonomy, incentivization, cognitive compatibility, and divergent rationalities. Although each of the presented themes addresses distinct features of an algorithmic decision aid, human users of the decision aid, and/or the decision making environment, apparent interdependencies are highlighted. We conclude that resolving algorithm aversion requires an updated research program with an emphasis on theory integration. We provide a number of empirical questions that can be immediately carried forth by the behavioral decision making community.

ID-022,article,Overcoming algorithm aversion: People will use imperfect algorithms if they can (even slightly) modify them,"Although evidence-based algorithms consistently outperform human forecasters, people often fail to use them after learning that they are imperfect, a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion. In this paper, we present three studies investigating how to reduce algorithm aversion. In incentivized forecasting tasks, participants chose between using their own forecasts or those of an algorithm that was built by experts. Participants were considerably more likely to choose to use an imperfect algorithm when they could modify its forecasts, and they performed better as a result. Notably, the preference for modifiable algorithms held even when participants were severely restricted in the modifications they could make (Studies 1–3). In fact, our results suggest that participants’ preference for modifiable algorithms was indicative of a desire for some control over the forecasting outcome, and not for a desire for greater control over the forecasting outcome, as participants’ preference for modifiable algorithms was relatively insensitive to the magnitude of the modifications they were able to make (Study 2). Additionally, we found that giving participants the freedom to modify an imperfect algorithm made them feel more satisfied with the forecasting process, more likely to believe that the algorithm was superior, and more likely to choose to use an algorithm to make subsequent forecasts (Study 3). This research suggests that one can reduce algorithm aversion by giving people some control—even a slight amount—over an imperfect algorithm’s forecast.",https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/overcoming-algorithm-aversion-people-will-use/docview/2167953950/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Overcoming+algorithm+aversion%3A+People+will+use+imperfect+algorithms+if+they+can+%28even+slightly%29+modify+them&title=Management+Science&issn=00251909&date=2018-03-01&volume=64&issue=3&spage=1155&au=Dietvorst%2C+Berkeley+J.%3BSimmons%2C+Joseph+P.%3BMassey%2C+Cade&isbn=&jtitle=Management+Science&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2018-16717-004&rft_id=info:doi/10.1287%2Fmnsc.2016.2643,1,1,1,,,,,Berkeley J Dietvorst and Joseph P Simmons and Cade Massey,https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2643,"0025-1909, 0025-1909",3,Management Science,"2340:Cognitive Processes,Adulthood (18 yrs & older),Algorithms,Aversion,Decision Making,Empirical Study,Female,Human,Male,Quantitative Study,US,algorithm aversion,article,decision making,forecasting",3,"Copyright - © 2016, INFORMS",1155-1170,2167953950; 2018-16717-004,Institute for Operations Research & the Management Sciences (INFORMS),64,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/overcoming-algorithm-aversion-people-will-use/docview/2167953950/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Overcoming+algorithm+aversion%3A+People+will+use+imperfect+algorithms+if+they+can+%28even+slightly%29+modify+them&title=Management+Science&issn=00251909&date=2018-03-01&volume=64&issue=3&spage=1155&au=Dietvorst%2C+Berkeley+J.%3BSimmons%2C+Joseph+P.%3BMassey%2C+Cade&isbn=&jtitle=Management+Science&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2018-16717-004&rft_id=info:doi/10.1287%2Fmnsc.2016.2643,2018,,
ID-023,article,Algorithm aversion: People erroneously avoid algorithms after seeing them err,"Research shows that evidence-based algorithms more accurately predict the future than do human forecasters. Yet when forecasters are deciding whether to use a human forecaster or a statistical algorithm, they often choose the human forecaster. This phenomenon, which we call algorithm aversion, is costly, and it is important to understand its causes. We show that people are especially averse to algorithmic forecasters after seeing them perform, even when they see them outperform a human forecaster. This is because people more quickly lose confidence in algorithmic than human forecasters after seeing them make the same mistake. In 5 studies, participants either saw an algorithm make forecasts, a human make forecasts, both, or neither. They then decided whether to tie their incentives to the future predictions of the algorithm or the human. Participants who saw the algorithm perform were less confident in it, and less likely to choose it over an inferior human forecaster. This was true even among those who saw the algorithm outperform the human.

Study 1 reports confirmatory validation of the General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) following initial validation elsewhere. Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed the two-factor structure (Positive, Negative) and showed good convergent and divergent validity with a related scale. Study 2 tested whether psychological factors (Big Five personality traits, corporate distrust, and general trust) predicted attitudes towards AI. Introverts had more positive attitudes towards AI overall, likely because of algorithm appreciation. Conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with forgiving attitudes towards negative aspects of AI. Higher corporate distrust led to negative attitudes towards AI overall, while higher general trust led to positive views of the benefits of AI. The dissociation between general trust and corporate distrust may reflect the public’s attributions of the benefits and drawbacks of AI.

ID-025,article,Algorithm appreciation: People prefer algorithmic to human judgment,"Even though computational algorithms often outperform human judgment, received wisdom suggests that people may be skeptical of relying on them (Dawes, 1979). Counter to this notion, results from six experiments show that lay people adhere more to advice when they think it comes from an algorithm than from a person. People showed this effect, what we call algorithm appreciation, when making numeric estimates about a visual stimulus (Experiment 1A) and forecasts about the popularity of songs and romantic attraction (Experiments 1B and 1C). Yet, researchers predicted the opposite result (Experiment 1D). Algorithm appreciation persisted when advice appeared jointly or separately (Experiment 2). However, algorithm appreciation waned when: people chose between an algorithm’s estimate and their own (versus an external advisor’s; Experiment 3) and they had expertise in forecasting (Experiment 4). Paradoxically, experienced professionals, who make forecasts on a regular basis, relied less on algorithmic advice than lay people did, which hurt their accuracy. These results shed light on the important question of when people rely on algorithmic advice over advice from people and have implications for the use of “big data” and algorithmic advice it generates.",https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/algorithm-appreciation-people-prefer-algorithmic/docview/2202920929/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Algorithm+appreciation%3A+People+prefer+algorithmic+to+human+judgment&title=Organizational+Behavior+and+Human+Decision+Processes&issn=07495978&date=2019-03-01&volume=151&issue=&spage=90&au=Logg%2C+Jennifer+M.%3BMinson%2C+Julia+A.%3BMoore%2C+Don+A.&isbn=&jtitle=Organizational+Behavior+and+Human+Decision+Processes&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2019-16202-008&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.obhdp.2018.12.005,1,1,1,"visual estimation, predictions about song popularity and romantic attraction",,,,Jennifer M Logg and Julia A Minson and Don A Moore,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2018.12.005,"0749-5978, 0749-5978",,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,"2340:Cognitive Processes,Adulthood (18 yrs & older),Algorithms,Empirical Study,Female,Human,Judgment,Male,Preferences,Quantitative Study,US,advice taking,algorithm appreciation,algorithms,article,human judgment",3,"Copyright - © 2018, Elsevier Inc.

ID-026,article,Factors related to user perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI)-based content moderation on social media,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based moderation systems have been increasingly used by social media companies to identify and remove inappropriate user-generated content (e.g., misinformation) on their platforms. Previous research on AI moderation has primarily focused on situational and technological factors in predicting users’ perceptions of it, while little is known about the role of individual characteristics. To bridge this gap, this study examined whether and how familiarity, political ideology, and algorithm acceptance are related to perceptions of AI moderation. By analyzing survey data from a nationally representative panel in the United States (N = 4562), we found that individuals who were more familiar with AI moderation expressed less favorable perceptions of it. Those who identified themselves as liberals were more likely to view AI moderation positively than those who identified themselves as conservatives. The higher the algorithm acceptance, the more favorable the perception. Moreover, trust in AI moderation significantly mediated the relationship between these three individual characteristics (familiarity, political ideology, and algorithm acceptance) and perceptions. The findings enrich the current understanding of user responses to AI moderation and provide practical implications for policymakers and designers.

ID-027,article,Addressing bias in artificial intelligence for public health surveillance,"Components of artificial intelligence (AI) for analysing social big data, such as natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, have improved the timeliness and robustness of health data. NLP techniques have been implemented to analyse large volumes of text from social media platforms to gain insights on disease symptoms, understand barriers to care and predict disease outbreaks. However, AI-based decisions may contain biases that could misrepresent populations, skew results or lead to errors. Bias, within the scope of this paper, is described as the difference between the predictive values and true values within the modelling of an algorithm. Bias within algorithms may lead to inaccurate healthcare outcomes and exacerbate health disparities when results derived from these biased algorithms are applied to health interventions. Researchers who implement these algorithms must consider when and how bias may arise. This paper explores algorithmic biases as a result of data collection, labelling and modelling of NLP algorithms. Researchers have a role in ensuring that efforts towards combating bias are enforced, especially when drawing health conclusions derived from social media posts that are linguistically diverse. Through the implementation of open collaboration, auditing processes and the development of guidelines, researchers may be able to reduce bias and improve NLP algorithms that improve health surveillance.

ID-028,article,Can algorithm knowledge stop women from being targeted by algorithm bias? The new digital divide on Weibo,"Algorithm knowledge of users plays a crucial role in avoiding them from algorithm bias in recommendation systems. Gender of users has been found to correlate with algorithm bias, but also leaving behind a question of whether this relationship can be described by algorithm knowledge. By using Weibo as an example system, we clarify the aforementioned question from a digital divide theory perspective. We combine a traditional method (questionnaire) with a deep learning computational method to explain algorithm bias in two sequential studies. Our findings suggest that algorithm knowledge solely works for men while fails to protect women. Who users follow helps determine what information they are exposed to on Weibo, and this renders female users’ algorithm knowledge useless. This work provides a valuable perspective on algorithm bias: we view algorithm bias as a new digital divide and contribute to the understanding of gender differences by applying the digital divide perspective. Methodologically, we contribute by integrating traditional and computational methods to explain algorithm bias from a folk theory perspective.

ID-029,article,"A simulation-enhanced, spaced learning, interprofessional “code blue” curriculum improves ACLS algorithm adherence and trainee resuscitation skill confidence","In-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation training often happens in silos, with minimal interprofessional training. The aim of this study was to implement and evaluate a simulation-enhanced, interprofessional cardiac arrest curriculum in a university hospital. The curriculum ran monthly for 12 months, training interprofessional teams of internal medicine residents, nurses, respiratory therapists, and pharmacy residents. Teams participated in a 90-min high-fidelity simulation including “code blue” (30 min) followed by a 30-min debriefing and a repeat identical simulated “code blue” scenario. Teams were tested in an unannounced mock Code Blue the following month. Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) algorithm adherence was assessed using a standardized checklist. In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) incidence and survival was tracked for 2 years prior, during, and 1 year after curriculum implementation. Team ACLS-algorithm adherence at baseline varied from 47% to 90% (mean of 71 ± 11%) and improved immediately following training (mean 88 ± 4%, range 80–93%",https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/simulation-enhanced-spaced-learning/docview/2860830339/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=A+simulation-enhanced%2C+spaced+learning%2C+interprofessional+%26ldquo%3Bcode+blue%26rdquo%3B+curriculum+improves+ACLS+algorithm+adherence+and+trainee+resuscitation+skill+confidence&title=Journal+of+Interprofessional+Care&issn=13561820&date=2023-07-01&volume=37&issue=4&spage=623&au=Toft%2C+Lorrel+E.+B.%3BBottinor%2C+Wendy%3BCobourn%2C+Andrew%3BBlount%2C+Courtland%3BTripathi%2C+Avnish%3BMehta%2C+Ishan%3BKoch%2C+Jennifer&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+Interprofessional+Care&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2023-77900-012&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F13561820.2022.2140130,3,,,,,,,Lorrel E B Toft and Wendy Bottinor and Andrew Cobourn and Courtland Blount and Avnish Tripathi and Ishan Mehta and Jennifer Koch,https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2022.2140130,"1356-1820, 1356-1820",4,Journal of Interprofessional Care,"3410:Professional Education & Training,Adulthood (18 yrs & older),Algorithmic Bias,Algorithms,Curriculum,Empirical Study,Female,Heart Disorders,Hospital Admission,Human,In-hospital,Life Sustaining Treatment,Male,Quantitative Study,Simulation,Teams,US,advanced cardiac life support,article,cardiac arrest,cardiac arrest training,code blue,interprofessional education",,"Copyright - © 2022, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC",623-628,2860830339; 2023-77900-012,Taylor & Francis Informa Healthcare,37,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/simulation-enhanced-spaced-learning/docview/2860830339/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=A+simulation-enhanced%2C+spaced+learning%2C+interprofessional+%26ldquo%3Bcode+blue%26rdquo%3B+curriculum+improves+ACLS+algorithm+adherence+and+trainee+resuscitation+skill+confidence&title=Journal+of+Interprofessional+Care&issn=13561820&date=2023-07-01&volume=37&issue=4&spage=623&au=Toft%2C+Lorrel+E.+B.%3BBottinor%2C+Wendy%3BCobourn%2C+Andrew%3BBlount%2C+Courtland%3BTripathi%2C+Avnish%3BMehta%2C+Ishan%3BKoch%2C+Jennifer&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+Interprofessional+Care&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2023-77900-012&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F13561820.2022.2140130,2023,,
ID-030,article,Understanding search autocompletes from the perspectives of english and spanish speakers during the early months of the covid‐19 pandemic,"The purpose of the study was to explore differences in Google search autocompletes between English and Spanish‐speaking users during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. Twenty‐nine individuals who were in areas with shelter‐in‐place state orders participated in a virtual focus group meeting to understand the algorithm bias of COVID‐19 Google autocompletes. The three focus group meetings lasted for 90–120 minutes. A codebook was created and transcripts were coded using NVivo qualitative software with a 95% intercoder reliability between two coders. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Among the 29 participants, six self‐identified as White, seven as Black/African American, five as American Indian or Alaska Native, four as Asian Indian, and three as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. In terms of ethnicity, 21 participants identified as Hispanic/Latino. The themes that emerged from the study were: (1) autocompletes evoked fear and stress; (2) skepticism and hesitation towards autocomplete search; (3) familiarity with COVID‐19 information impacts outlook on autocomplete search; (4) autocompletes can promote preselection of searches; and (5) lesser choice of autocomplete results for Spanish‐speaking searchers. Spanish speakers expressed concerns and hesitation due to social factors and lack of information about COVID‐19.

ID-031,article,Applicants’ fairness perceptions of algorithm-driven hiring procedures,"Despite the rapid adoption of technology in human resource departments, there is little empirical work that examines the potential challenges of algorithmic decision-making in the recruitment process. In this paper, we take the perspective of job applicants and examine how they perceive the use of algorithms in selection and recruitment. Across four studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we show that people in the role of a job applicant perceive algorithm-driven recruitment processes as less fair compared to human only or algorithm-assisted human processes. This effect persists regardless of whether the outcome is favorable to the applicant or not. A potential mechanism underlying algorithm resistance is the belief that algorithms will not be able to recognize their uniqueness as a candidate. Although the use of algorithms has several benefits for organizations such as improved efficiency and bias reduction, our results highlight a potential cost of using them to screen potential employees during recruitment.

ID-032,article,Themed issue introduction: Promises and perils of artificial intelligence and advertising,"The article briefs about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence (AI) and advertising. Combined, the six articles represent what authors believe is a unique contribution to advertising theory development and practice. A key point to remember is that theoretical-based considerations are necessary for guiding the improvement of algorithm performance in AI advertising. In addition to the efficiency and privacy trade-off issue mentioned, another important problem connected to all these themed issue articles is an emerging issue of algorithm bias and algorithmic transparency and fairness. Algorithmic transparency is an emerging interdisciplinary subfield in computer science that focuses, in part, on understanding why algorithms make the decisions that they do. A lack of awareness and understanding of algorithm bias among the general public is a significant emerging issue that requires serious intervention to improve algorithm literacy; authors also notice that a lot of social science scholars, including advertising researchers, also seem to assume a value-neutral and unbiased nature of AI algorithms, which is quite dangerous in many ways. Thus, in addition to offering suggestions for improving the technology needed to examine theories of AI advertising, themed issue studies offer explanations and guidance for understanding how or why AI may be helping and/or standing in the way of future progress in advertising. Authors intention is to stimulate interdisciplinary research which will have a substantial impact on thinking and which leads to additional research on AI advertising in the years ahead.

ID-033,article,Soul and machine (learning),"Machine learning is bringing us self-driving cars, medical diagnoses, and language translation, but how can machine learning help marketers improve marketing decisions? Machine learning models predict extremely well, are scalable to “big data,” and are a natural fit to analyze rich media content, such as text, images, audio, and video. Examples of current marketing applications include identification of customer needs from online data, accurate prediction of consumer response to advertising, personalized pricing, and product recommendations. But without the human input and insight—the soul—the applications of machine learning are limited. To create competitive or cooperative strategies, to generate creative product designs, to be accurate for “what-if” and “but-for” applications, to devise dynamic policies, to advance knowledge, to protect consumer privacy, and avoid algorithm bias, machine learning needs a soul. The brightest future is based on the synergy of what the machine can do well and what humans do well. We provide examples and predictions for the future.

ID-035,article,Outcome assessment of an antipsychotic drug algorithm: Effects of the Mississippi State Hospital Algorithm project,"Objective: This study evaluated a state psychiatric hospital’s algorithm for prescribing antipsychotic drugs for inpatients with schizophrenia to determine whether its emphasis on cost efficiency is compatible with quality of care. Methods: Outcomes were compared for patients who received medication that was algorithm adherent or nonadherent. Risperidone and ziprasidone were first-step oral antipsychotics. Documentation of clinical rationale was acceptable for nonpreferred drug use. Outcomes of interest were length of hospitalization and “much improved” or “very much improved” status on the Clinical Global Impression severity scale (CGI-S). Results: Of 401 patients, 70% were male. The CGI-S modal rating of severity was “markedly ill.” Duration of illness was longer for patients given algorithm-non-adherent (17.6±9.7 years) versus - adherent (14.9±11.6 years, p=.013) medication. No statistically significant between-group differences were observed for mean length of stay (51.4±35.5 days versus 43.8±27.4 days, adjusted difference p=.18) or median improvement time (adherent, 41 days; non adherent, 42 days; CI= 34–48 days for both group medians).

ID-036,article,Artificial intelligence and environment behavior psychology based evolution of science fiction movie genres,"The awareness of technological influence has grown, culminating in an increased appreciation for science fiction (sci-fi) movies. Positioned as an imaginative genre with a longstanding history in the film industry, sci-fi movies have witnessed substantial popularity. In the context of uninterrupted advancements in human science and innovation over recent years, numerous scientific and technological breakthroughs have reshaped societal norms. This transformative process not only enhances individuals' lives but also holds educational significance. This investigation sought to explore the potential correlation between the evolution of sci-fi film genres and the psychology of artificial intelligence (AI) environmental behavior. A novel aspect of this study is its interdisciplinary approach, amalgamating elements of film studies and environmental psychology. The examination of how sci-fi films both reflect and influence the societal perception of AI and its environmental ramifications contributes to a profound comprehension of the complex interaction within the realm of sci-fi, technology, and societal dynamics. The study employed a virtual scene construction method for sci-fi movies based on AI. Data were meticulously collected from a diverse cohort, comprising 1,000 movie enthusiasts and 260 individuals specifically inclined towards sci-fi films in China. Utilizing a combination of random sampling and snowball sampling techniques, questionnaires were employed to gather insights. Notably, the study's findings suggest a future trajectory where sci-fi films will seamlessly integrate AI-driven storytelling techniques. This integration is poised to create immersive cinematic experiences, actively engaging viewers in ethical and environmental dilemmas.

ID-037,article,Scoring the ethics of ai robo-advice: Why we need gateways and ratings,"Unlike the many services already transformed by artificial intelligence (AI), the financial advice sector remains committed to a human interface. That is surprising as an AI-powered financial advisor (a robo-advisor) can offer personalised financial advice at much lower cost than traditional human advice. This is particularly important for those who need but cannot afford or access traditional financial advice. Robo-advice is easily accessible, available on-demand, and pools all relevant information in finding and implementing an optimal financial plan. In a perfectly competitive market for financial advice, robo-advice should prevail. Unfortunately, this market is imperfect with asymmetric information causing generalised advice aversion with a disproportionate lack of trust in robo-advice. Initial distrust makes advice clients reluctant to use, or switch to, robo-advice. This paper investigates the ethical concerns specific to robo-advice underpinning this lack of trust. We propose a regulatory framework addressing these concerns to ensure robo-advice can be an ethical resource for good, resolving the increasing complexity of financial decision-making. Fit for purpose regulation augments initial trust in robo-advice and supports advice clients in discriminating between high-trust and low-trust robo-advisors. Aspiring robo-advisors need to clear four licensing gateways to qualify for an AI Robo-Advice License (AIRAL). Licensed robo-advisors should then be monitored for ethical compliance. Using a balanced score card for ethical performance generates an ethics rating. This gateways-and-ratings methodology builds trust in the robo-advisory market through improved transparency, reduced information asymmetry, and lower risk of adverse selection.

ID-038,article,Beyond the front yard: The dehumanizing message of accent-altering technology,"Over the past decade, the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, as it relates to the speech and voice recognition industry, has established itself as a multibillion-dollar global market, but at whose expense? In this forum article, we amplify the current critiques of the architectures of large language models being used increasingly in daily life. Our commentary exposes emerging AI accent modification technology and services as agents of racial commodification and linguistic dominance, as it rests on the perceived superiority of standardized US English. We discuss our concern for such services leaching into academia. We argue that this technology follows a standardized language framework, which poses a fundamental problem of being informed by purist monolingual principles. These principles often help to perpetuate and maintain harmful raciolinguistic ideologies that result in language discrimination and the continual framing of the language practices of racially minoritized speakers as deficient. Thus, we write this piece with the intent to expose the fabricated humanity of accent modification technology whose existence perpetuates capitalism’s reliance on dehumanization for economic advancement and the legacy and reproduction of white language superiority.

ID-039,article,Advances in the application of AI robots in critical care: Scoping review,"Background: In recent epochs, the field of critical medicine has experienced significant advancements due to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, AI robots have evolved from theoretical concepts to being actively implemented in clinical trials and applications. The intensive care unit (ICU), known for its reliance on a vast amount of medical information, presents a promising avenue for the deployment of robotic AI, anticipated to bring substantial improvements to patient care. Objective: This review aims to comprehensively summarize the current state of AI robots in the field of critical care by searching for previous studies, developments, and applications of AI robots related to ICU wards. In addition, it seeks to address the ethical challenges arising from their use, including concerns related to safety, patient privacy, responsibility delineation, and cost-benefit analysis. Methods: Following the scoping review framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, we conducted a scoping review to delineate the breadth of research in this field of AI robots in ICU and reported the findings. The literature search was carried out on May 1, 2023, across 3 databases: PubMed, Embase, and the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Eligible publications were initially screened based on their titles and abstracts. Publications that passed the preliminary screening underwent a comprehensive review. Various research characteristics were extracted, summarized, and analyzed from the final publications. Results: Of the 5908 publications screened, 77 (1.3%) underwent a full review. These studies collectively spanned 21 ICU robotics projects, encompassing their system development and testing, clinical trials, and approval processes. Upon an expert-reviewed classification framework, these were categorized into 5 main types: therapeutic assistance robots, nursing assistance robots, rehabilitation assistance robots, telepresence robots, and logistics and disinfection robots. Most of these are already widely deployed and commercialized in ICUs, although a select few remain under testing. All robotic systems and tools are engineered to deliver more personalized, convenient, and intelligent medical services to patients in the ICU, concurrently aiming to reduce the substantial workload on ICU medical staff and promote therapeutic and care procedures. This review further explored the prevailing challenges, particularly focusing on ethical and safety concerns, proposing viable solutions or methodologies, and illustrating the prospective capabilities and potential of AI-driven robotic technologies in the ICU environment. Ultimately, we foresee a pivotal role for robots in a future scenario of a fully automated continuum from admission to discharge within the ICU. Conclusions: This review highlights the potential of AI robots to transform ICU care by improving patient treatment, support, and rehabilitation processes. However, it also recognizes the ethical complexities and operational challenges that come with their implementation, offering possible solutions for future development and optimization.

ID-040,article,Who made that decision and why? Users’ perceptions of human versus ai decision-making and the power of explainable-ai,"With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) based systems, a new era has begun. Decisions that were once made by humans are now increasingly being made by these advanced systems, with the inevitable consequence of our growing reliance on AI in many aspects of our lives. At the same time, the opaque nature of AI-based systems and the possibility of unintentional or hidden discriminatory practices and biases raises profound questions not only about the mechanics of AI, but also about how users perceive the fairness of these systems. We hypothesize that providing various explanations for AI decision-making processes and output may enhance users’ fairness perceptions and make them trust the system and adopt its decisions. Hence, we devised an online between-subject experiment that explores users’ fairness and comprehension perceptions of AI systems with respect to the explanations provided by the system, employing a case study of a managerial decision in the human resources (HR) domain. We manipulated (i) the decision-maker (AI or human); (ii) the input (candidate characteristics); (iii) the output (recommendation valence), and (iv) the explanation style. We examined the effect of the various manipulations (and individuals’ demographic and personality characteristics) using multivariate ordinal regression. We also performed a multi-level analysis of experiment components to examine the effects of the decision-maker type, explanation style, and their combination. The results suggest three main conclusions. The first conclusion is that there is a gap in users’ fairness and comprehension perception of AI-based decision making systems compared to human decision making. The second conclusion is that knowing that an AI-based system provided the decisions negatively affects users’ fairness and comprehension perceptions, compared to knowing that humans made the decision. Finally, the third conclusion is that providing case-based, certification-based, or sensitivity-based explanations can narrow this gap and may even eliminate it. Additionally, we found that users’ fairness and comprehension perceptions are influenced by a variety of factors such as the input, output, and explanation provided by the system, as well as by individuals’ age, education, computer skills, and personality. Our findings may help to understand when and how to use explanations to improve users’ perceptions regarding AI-based decision-making.

ID-041,article,Development and validation of instruments for assessing the impact of artificial intelligence on students in higher education,"The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in education remains incompletely understood, demanding further evaluation and the creation of robust assessment tools. Despite previous attempts to measure AI's impact in education, existing studies have limitations. This research aimed to develop and validate an assessment instrument for gauging AI effects in higher education. Employing various analytical methods, including Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and Rasch Analysis, the initial 70-item instrument covered seven constructs. Administered to 635 students at Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology—Gabaldon campus, content validity was assessed using the Lawshe method. After eliminating 19 items through EFA and CFA, Rasch analysis confirmed the construct validity and led to the removal of three more items. The final 48-item instrument, categorized into learning experiences, academic performance, career guidance, motivation, self-reliance, social interactions, and AI dependency, emerged as a valid and reliable tool for assessing AI's impact on higher education, especially among college students.

ID-042,article,Large language models and user trust: Consequence of self-referential learning loop and the deskilling of health care professionals,"As the health care industry increasingly embraces large language models (LLMs), understanding the consequence of this integration becomes crucial for maximizing benefits while mitigating potential pitfalls. This paper explores the evolving relationship among clinician trust in LLMs, the transition of data sources from predominantly human-generated to artificial intelligence (AI)–generated content, and the subsequent impact on the performance of LLMs and clinician competence. One of the primary concerns identified in this paper is the LLMs’ self-referential learning loops, where AI-generated content feeds into the learning algorithms, threatening the diversity of the data pool, potentially entrenching biases, and reducing the efficacy of LLMs. While theoretical at this stage, this feedback loop poses a significant challenge as the integration of LLMs in health care deepens, emphasizing the need for proactive dialogue and strategic measures to ensure the safe and effective use of LLM technology. Another key takeaway from our investigation is the role of user expertise and the necessity for a discerning approach to trusting and validating LLM outputs. The paper highlights how expert users, particularly clinicians, can leverage LLMs to enhance productivity by off-loading routine tasks while maintaining a critical oversight to identify and correct potential inaccuracies in AI-generated content. This balance of trust and skepticism is vital for ensuring that LLMs augment rather than undermine the quality of patient care. We also discuss the risks associated with the deskilling of health care professionals. Frequent reliance on LLMs for critical tasks could result in a decline in health care providers’ diagnostic and thinking skills, particularly affecting the training and development of future professionals. The legal and ethical considerations surrounding the deployment of LLMs in health care are also examined. We discuss the medicolegal challenges, including liability in cases of erroneous diagnoses or treatment advice generated by LLMs. The paper references recent legislative efforts, such as The Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2023, as crucial steps toward establishing a framework for the ethical and responsible use of AI-based technologies in health care. In conclusion, this paper advocates for a strategic approach to integrating LLMs into health care. By emphasizing the importance of maintaining clinician expertise, fostering critical engagement with LLM outputs, and navigating the legal and ethical landscape, we can ensure that LLMs serve as valuable tools in enhancing patient care and supporting health care professionals. This approach addresses the immediate challenges posed by integrating LLMs and sets a foundation for their maintainable and responsible use in the future.

ID-043,article,Choosing human over AI doctors? How comparative trust associations and knowledge relate to risk and benefit perceptions of AI in healthcare,"The development of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is accelerating rapidly. Beyond the urge for technological optimization, public perceptions and preferences regarding the application of such technologies remain poorly understood. Risk and benefit perceptions of novel technologies are key drivers for successful implementation. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the factors that condition these perceptions. In this study, we draw on the risk perception and human‐AI interaction literature to examine how explicit (i.e., deliberate) and implicit (i.e., automatic) comparative trust associations with AI versus physicians, and knowledge about AI, relate to likelihood perceptions of risks and benefits of AI in healthcare and preferences for the integration of AI in healthcare. We use survey data (n = 378) to specify a path model. Results reveal that the path for implicit comparative trust associations on relative preferences for AI over physicians is only significant through risk, but not through benefit perceptions. This finding is reversed for AI knowledge. Explicit comparative trust associations relate to AI preference through risk and benefit perceptions. These findings indicate that risk perceptions of AI in healthcare might be driven more strongly by affect‐laden factors than benefit perceptions, which in turn might depend more on reflective cognition. Implications of our findings and directions for future research are discussed considering the conceptualization of trust as heuristic and dual‐process theories of judgment and decision‐making. Regarding the design and implementation of AI‐based healthcare technologies, our findings suggest that a holistic integration of public viewpoints is warranted.

ID-044,article,Do large language models show decision heuristics similar to humans? A case study using GPT-3.5,"A Large Language Model (LLM) is an artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of natural language data, enabling it to generate human-like responses to written or spoken language input. Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5 is an example of an LLM that supports a conversational agent called ChatGPT. In this work, we used a series of novel prompts to determine whether ChatGPT shows heuristics and other context-sensitive responses. We also tested the same prompts on human participants. Across four studies, we found that ChatGPT was influenced by random anchors in making estimates (anchoring, Study 1); it judged the likelihood of two events occurring together to be higher than the likelihood of either event occurring alone, and it was influenced by anecdotal information (representativeness and availability heuristic, Study 2); it found an item to be more efficacious when its features were presented positively rather than negatively—even though both presentations contained statistically equivalent information (framing effect, Study 3); and it valued an owned item more than a newly found item even though the two items were objectively identical (endowment effect, Study 4). In each study, human participants showed similar effects. Heuristics and context-sensitive responses in humans are thought to be driven by cognitive and affective processes such as loss aversion and effort reduction. The fact that an LLM—which lacks these processes—also shows such responses invites consideration of the possibility that language is sufficiently rich to carry these effects and may play a role in generating these effects in humans.

ID-046,article,Students' reflections on their experience with chatgpt,"Background The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence has brought a number of ethical and practical issues to higher education. Solid experimental evidence is yet inadequate to set the functional rules for the new technology. Objectives The objective of this study is to analyse the experience of undergraduate students’ interaction with ChatGPT and contribute to identifying the problems arising from the widespread use of artificial intelligence. Methods Junior university students (N = 25) were assigned the task of working on their seminar essays with the aid of ChatGPT. Most students were novices with this tool (the study was conducted in the spring of 2023). Their essays were analysed qualitatively, according to the principles of the general inductive approach. Results and Conclusions The initial attitudes towards artificial intelligence were almost equally distributed from enthusiastic to indifferent and cautious, with one student refusing to interact with the chatbot on ideological grounds. After the first experience, most of the students declared themselves adopters of the new technology. We have found some evidence for enhancing critical thinking competence when using ChatGPT, as well as examples of unquestioned reliance on its outputs. The tendency to personification of the chatbot was apparent in the students' essays. Implications The findings show how easily the students embrace artificial intelligence and suggest a failure of any attempts for its strict regulation. This, on the other hand, underlines the need for emphasis on personal and research‐oriented approaches in teaching and learning.

ID-048,article,"How decision making develops: Adolescents, irrational adults, and should AI be trusted with the car keys?","This paper reviews the developmental literature on decision making, discussing how increased reliance on gist thinking explains the surprising finding that important cognitive biases increase from childhood to adulthood. This developmental trend can be induced experimentally by encouraging verbatim (younger) versus gist (older) ways of thinking. We then build on this developmental literature to assess the developmental stage of artificial intelligence (AI) and how its decision making compares with humans, finding that popular models are not only irrational but they sometimes resemble immature adolescents. To protect public safety and avoid risk, we propose that AI models build on policy frameworks already established to regulate other immature decision makers such as adolescents.

ID-049,article,Developing and leveraging proactive personality to bridge the soft skills gap,"There is a gap in the current labor market of protean workers who possess the uniquely human soft skills required by the increased reliance on artificial intelligence and digitization brought by the fourth industrial revolution. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to use the agentic perspective of Bandura's social cognitive theory to understand how existing employees' proactive personality is seen and experienced in the workplace. Using the human capital view on existing talent, this study explored how the soft skill of proactive personality can be developed in existing employees for the self-identification of opportunities for upskilling or reskilling when faced with skills obsolescence or shifting skill requirements. Six managers and four individual contributors at U.S. organizations participated in semistructured interviews to describe their lived experiences of responding to shifting skill requirements. Findings from coded analysis using Belwalkar and Tobacyk's tripartite model taxonomy of proactive personality indicated that existing talent can be developed by leaders to provide positive social change that empowers individuals to become and remain relevant and employable throughout their careers. Findings revealed that by developing existing employees to become more proactive, organizations can create sustainable mindset shifts, habits, and behaviors that can mitigate the soft skills gap. Findings could be used to decrease unemployment, poverty, and inequality of income, and could increase societal dignity by keeping people employed and organizations competitive and profitable.

ID-050,article,Employees adhere more to unethical instructions from human than AI supervisors: Complementing experimental evidence with machine learning,"The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in organizations has fundamentally changed from performing routine tasks to supervising human employees. While prior studies focused on normative perceptions of such (n= 1701) and used two state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (causal forest and transformers). We consistently find that employees adhere less to unethical instructions from an AI than a human supervisor. Further, individual characteristics such as the tendency to comply without dissent or age constitute important boundary conditions. In addition, Study 1 identified that the perceived mind of the supervisors serves as an explanatory mechanism. We generate further insights on this mediator via experimental manipulations in two pre-registered studies by manipulating mind between two AI (Study 2) and two human supervisors (Study 3). In (pre-registered) Study 4, we replicate the resistance to unethical instructions from AI supervisors in an incentivized experimental setting. Our research generates insights into the ‘black box’ of human behavior toward AI supervisors, particularly in the moral domain, and showcases how organizational researchers can use machine learning methods as powerful tools to complement experimental research for the generation of more fine-grained insights.

ID-052,article,Improving trust in ai with mitigating confirmation bias: Effects of explanation type and debiasing strategy for decision-making with explainable ai,"Abstract With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing the explainability of complex machine learning models. However, the explanations generated by an XAI may lead to cognitive biases among human users. To address this problem, this study aims to investigate how to mitigate users’ cognitive biases based on their individual characteristics. In the literature review, we found two factors that can be helpful in remedying biases: 1) debiasing strategies that have been reported to potentially reduce biases in users’ decision-making via additional information or change in information delivery, and 2) explanation modality types. To examine these factors’ effects, we conducted an experiment with a 4 (debiasing strategy) × 3 (explanation type) between-subject design. In the experiment, participants were exposed to an explainable interface that provides an AI’s outcomes with explanatory information, and their behavioral and attitudinal responses were collected. Specifically, we statistically examined the effects of textual and visual explanations on users’ trust and confirmation bias toward AI systems, considering the moderating effects of debiasing methods and watching time. The results demonstrated that textual explanations lead to higher trust in XAI systems compared to visual explanations. Moreover, we found that textual explanations are particularly beneficial for quick decision-makers to evaluate the outputs of AI systems. Next, the results indicated that the cognitive bias can be effectively mitigated by providing users with a priori information. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for designing AI-based decision support systems that can generate more trustworthy and equitable explanations.

ID-053,article,Eyes can tell: Assessment of implicit attitudes toward AI art,"Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly improved the abilities of machines. Human-unique abilities, such as art creation, are now being challenged by AI. Recent studies have investigated and compared people's attitudes toward human-made and AI-generated artworks. These results suggest that a negative bias may exist toward the latter. However, none of these previous studies has examined the extent of this bias. In this study, we investigate whether a bias against AI art can be found at an implicit level. Viewers’ attitudes toward AI art were assessed using eye-tracking measures and subjective aesthetic evaluations. Visual attention and aesthetic judgments were compared between artworks categorized as human-made and AI-made. The results showed that although it was difficult for individuals to identify AI-generated artwork, they exhibited an implicit prejudice against AI art. Participants looked longer at paintings that they thought were made by humans. No significant effect of categorization of paintings was found in subjective evaluations. These findings suggest that although human and AI art may be perceived as having similar aesthetic values, an implicit negative bias toward AI art exists. Although AI can now perform creative tasks, artistic creativity is still considered a human prerogative.

ID-055,article,Artificial intelligence applications in space medicine,"Introduction: During future interplanetary space missions, a number of health conditions may arise, owing to the hostile environment of space and the myriad of stressors experienced by the crew. When managing these conditions, crews will be required to make accurate, timely clinical decisions at a high level of autonomy, as telecommunication delays and increasing distances restrict real-time support from the ground. On Earth, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven successful in healthcare, augmenting expert clinical decision-making or enhancing medical knowledge where it is lacking. Similarly, deploying AI tools in the context of a space mission could improve crew self-reliance and healthcare delivery. Methods: We conducted a narrative review to discuss existing AI applications that could improve the prevention, recognition, evaluation, and management of the most mission-critical conditions, including psychological and mental health, acute radiation sickness, surgical emergencies, spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome, infections, and cardiovascular deconditioning. Results: Some examples of the applications we identified include AI chatbots designed to prevent and mitigate psychological and mental health conditions, automated medical imaging analysis, and closed-loop systems for hemodynamic optimization. We also discuss at length gaps in current technologies, as well as the key challenges and limitations of developing and deploying AI for space medicine to inform future research and innovation. Indeed, shifts in patient cohorts, space-induced physiological changes, limited size and breadth of space biomedical datasets, and changes in disease characteristics may render the models invalid when transferred from ground settings into space.

ID-056,article,Ai’s humanoid appearance can affect human perceptions of its emotional capability: Evidence from self-reported data in the u.S,"Abstract As artificial intelligence (AI) integration becomes more prominent in society, the infosphere becomes increasingly complex. A better understanding of the human-AI relationship is crucial during these rapid technological and social changes. Emotions are complex responses of the human mind – a highly advanced information processing system. Thus, examining how humans perceive AI’s emotional capability may provide helpful insights. Human physiological properties such as humanoid appearance and gender are suggested to be potential influencing factors. Following the information processing approach, we employed Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics on a dataset of 266 residents of the United States. Results show that interacting with an AI agent with human-like physical features is positively associated with the belief in that AI agent’s capability of experiencing emotional pain and pleasure. This effect is stronger in males than females. A possible explanation for these patterns is reliance on cognitive strategies used in interpersonal interactions, including gender-specific physiological properties. This study also demonstrates the effectiveness of using a compatible information processing analytical method such as BMF for studying humans’ perceptions of AI.

ID-057,article,I am attracted to myCool Smart Assistant! Analyzing Attachment-Aversion in AI-Human Relationships,"The conversation between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled intelligent voice assistants (IVA) can create bonds that go beyond a mere utilitarian purpose. The emotional cues in a Human-AI conversation can lead consumers to feel connected with the AI-agents and even consider such a relationship as cool. Although brand coolness is known to affect consumer behavior, little is known about how consumers perceive a close relationship with IVAs and what the drivers of their use or avoidance are. Therefore, the current paper adds to the literature by analyzing how AI-enabled voice assistant experience affects IVA coolness and customer-brand relationships using the attachment-aversion (A-A) theory. A total of 308 consumers showed that affective, behavioral, and intellectual experiences with the intelligent voice assistant affect IVA coolness. IVA coolness was also found to affect A-A relationships positively, influencing consumers’ motivational strength to adopt, maintain and enhance the relationship in the future.",https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/i-am-attracted-my-cool-smart-assistant-analyzing/docview/3064325256/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=I+am+attracted+to+myCool+Smart+Assistant%21+Analyzing+Attachment-Aversion+in+AI-Human+Relationships&title=Journal+of+Business+Research&issn=01482963&date=2023-06-01&volume=161&issue=&spage=&au=Guerreiro%2C+Jo%C3%A3o%3BLoureiro%2C+Sandra+Maria+Correia&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+Business+Research&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2023-60666-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jbusres.2023.113863,3,,,,,,,João Guerreiro and Sandra Maria Correia Loureiro,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2023.113863,"0148-2963, 0148-2963",,Journal of Business Research,"4120:Artificial Intelligence & Expert Systems,Adulthood (18 yrs & older),Aesthetics,Artificial Intelligence,Attachment-aversion theory,Conversation,Coolness,Empirical Study,Experience,Female,Human,Human Computer Interaction,Intelligent Agents,Intelligent voice assistants,Male,Quantitative Study,Voice,article",6,"Copyright - © 2023, The Author(s).

ID-058,article,Hotel AI service: Are employees still needed?,"This research adopts the artificial intelligence (AI) device usage acceptance (AIDUA) model and draws on cognitive appraisal theory. It articulates a mediated relationship leading from social influence, hedonic motivation, and anthropomorphism to acceptance of or objection to AI device usage through the mediation of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and customer emotion in the context of smart hotels. The study further draws on two-factor theory of emotion to identify the moderation of employee presence. Based on a survey design, our research adds to the literature by underscoring why human staff is still critical even in the smart service encounter, especially when customers are looking for superior performance with low effort when using AI devices. However, the presence of employees may be a hindrance in the low performance and high effort expectancies conditions. This research pinpoints a more precise mechanism of the role of employees and technology in delivering intended emotional valence.

ID-059,article,Willingness to produce disadvantageous outcomes in cooperative tasks is modulated by recent experience,"Cooperative behavior represents a situation in which individuals sometimes act in a way that produces a gain to another at a cost to themselves. This may be explained by a history of repeated interactions with others in which such behavior has resulted in reciprocal cooperation from others. Sometimes, even with reciprocal cooperation, gains and costs are unbalanced between partners. In this case, there is evidence that people may present an aversion to both disadvantageous and advantageous distributions of gains. In other words, they may act in such a way as to ensure an equal outcome among all group members. Aversion to inequity that benefits oneself (advantageous inequity (AI) aversion) may be more dependent on social and cultural cues than aversion to inequity that benefits others (disadvantageous inequity (DI) aversion). Using both between-subjects (Experiment 1) and within-subjects (Experiment 2) manipulations, the influence of recent experience with AI on participants’ willingness to produce DI was explored within the context of a two-player card game. In initial game phases, the percentage of trials in which the participant experienced AI was manipulated. In subsequent game phases, participants had the opportunity to produce DI to themselves. The results from both experiments suggest that aversion to DI is reduced by recent experience with AI. This procedure allows social influences on DI to be tested, which may be important for providing a psychological explanation of cultural differences in aversion to DI.

ID-060,article,Speciesism and preference of human–artificial intelligence interaction: A study on medical artificial intelligence,"Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the medical industry in the decade. It is critical to integrate human–computer interaction into daily clinic service and further increase the public acceptance of medical AI. Based on self-categorization theory, our research draws on speciesism as a vital cognitive factor to examine how patients’ speciesism affects their acceptance of medical AI in different roles. The study adopted a positivist research paradigm by examining 249 samples of data collected during COVID-19 in China. The results indicate that patients with higher speciesism tend to have lower acceptance of medical AI in an independent role but higher acceptance in an assistive role. Furthermore, we verified the mediating effect of human–computer trust and the positive moderating role of human uniqueness perception. This article expands the practicality of speciesism from human–animal relationships into human–AI relationships and contributes to human–computer interaction from the perspective of medical AI acceptance.

ID-061,inbook,Toward behavioral AI: Cognitive factors underlying the public psychology of Artificial Intelligence,"Companies and governments worldwide are incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms in various sectors to improve products and customer services along with attempts to improvise governance for citizens. We need a research agenda that builds up a behavioral science of AI targeted to gather insights about how the public thinks, judges, decides, and acts toward AI. The first part of the chapter focuses on the underpinnings of a psychological bias to prefer humans over algorithms even though algorithms work better than or as good as human experts on many tasks. Using the backdrop of national AI strategies, one can see that preferences for AI algorithms over humans are both domain-specific and task-sensitive. We cannot talk of a general preference for AI but need to take a more nuanced behavioral science approach. The next part discusses cognitive factors that underlie preferences toward AI algorithms like transparency, perception of algorithmic error, perceived understanding, risk levels, and uniqueness neglect. The later part highlights solutions that can attenuate aversion toward algorithms by communicating transparency of algorithmic processing, giving humans some control over algorithms, providing social proof, and making algorithms seem more humanlike. Our review of empirical research interspersed with practical suggestions on how we can make emerging technologies more acceptable and accountable would be of interest to link cognitive science with technology among academics, practitioners, and policymakers.

ID-062,article,Three essays in information technology and human resource management,"This dissertation consists of three chapters examining how new forms of information technology are impacting human resource management. Advances in machine learning, human resource management systems, and job platforms are transforming how firms compete for talent, how they match workers to projects and tasks, and how they motivate and retain their employees. My dissertation examines the causes and consequences of these changes to further understand not only how firms can use their human capital as a source of competitive advantage, but also how workers can thrive in the digital economy. Chapter 1 examines how job performance and demographic representation considerations impact the adoption of algorithms in hiring. Chapter 2 studies the effects of the adoption of artificial intelligence on teams and their performance and coordination using a laboratory experiment. Chapter 3 documents the rise of outsourced recruiting and proposes a new experimental tool, the two-sided audit, to increase our understanding of how firms hire. Overall, my dissertation seeks to further our understanding of firm human resource practices in the digital age by illustrating that this will require not only an understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of human versus machine prediction, but also an appreciation of behavioral responses by job candidates, workers, and managers alike.

ID-063,article,Communicating proximity: The effects of technology media on information sharing about artificial intelligence,"Construal-level theory suggests that people could view novel issues and phenomena like artificial intelligence (AI) as being psychologically distant, irrelevant to people like themselves and even less believable relative to more familiar or salient issues. Synchronously, empirical construal-level theory studies suggest that information related to novel issues like AI is more likely to be shared online when people perceive the topic as being psychologically proximal, relevant to people like themselves and believable. Therefore, understanding how media might encourage information sharing about novel technologies by communicating psychological proximity (e.g., a sense of nearness and personal relevance) is key to understanding how people form perceptions of new innovations and share these perceptions with others. I conducted two studies examining the influence of technology media-system dependency (study 1) and online technology media content (study 2) on AI information sharing online, through psychological proximity to the impacts of AI. In study 1, I surveyed a sample of US citizens 18 years and older about their media habits in relation to AI, and tested a process model predicting AI information sharing from technology media-system dependency. Results suggest an indirect positive association between reliance on media resources to meet goals related to AI and online AI information sharing, through priming psychological proximity. Perceived rate of technological change was found to moderate this model, enhancing the association between dependency and proximity, and the indirect association between dependency and information sharing, through proximity. In study 2, I exposed a sample of US citizens 18 years and older to manipulated media content reporting on the potential economic threats posed by AI. Results suggest that thematically framing the threat of AI primed psychological proximity over episodically framing similar information, contrary to the predictions of construal-level theory. Furthermore, thematically framed content was more shareable through its positive effects on psychological proximity to the impacts of AI and perceived AI threat in serial mediation. Discussions of implications, trajectory of future research and limitations are discussed through the lens of construal-level theory and individual-level media-systems dependency.

ID-064,article,Artificial intelligence (AI) in employee selection: How algorithm-based decision aids influence recruiters’ decision-making in resume screening,"With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), algorithm-based decision aids have been adopted by more and more organizations to help recruiters and hiring managers screen and review job candidates. This dissertation assesses how HR recruiters integrate selection information produced by algorithms into assessments of job candidates' qualifications to make the hiring decisions. To assess how algorithm-based decision aids are used, I first investigate how individual characteristics of recruiters influence their perceived usefulness of algorithm selection information. I then examine how recruiters rate applicant employability when they are given different types of jobs (HR Assistant vs. Data Engineer) and algorithm-based selection information. Results showed that younger managers, managers with AI use experience and more recent hiring experience perceived algorithm-based decision aids useful. Recruiters were less likely to see algorithm-based information as useful if they reported algorithm aversion. Similar relationships were found when managers rated employability when presented with information from both resumes and algorithm-based decision aids. Finally, I found that applicant information from algorithm-based decision aids had more influence on manager ratings of employability when the job requires more technical skills than when the job requires more soft skills. Theoretical and empirical implications are discussed.

ID-065,article,Better explaining the benefits why ai? Analyzing the impact of explaining the benefits of ai‐supported selection on applicant responses,"Despite the increasing popularity of AI‐supported selection tools, knowledge about the actions that can be taken by organizations to increase AI acceptance is still in its infancy, even though multiple studies point out that applicants react negatively to the implementation of AI‐supported selection tools. Therefore, this study investigates ways to alter applicant reactions to AI‐supported selection. Using a scenario‐based between‐subject design with participants from the working population (N = 200), we varied the information provided by the organization about the reasons for using an AI‐supported selection process (no additional information vs. written information vs. video information) in comparison to a human selection process. Results show that the use of AI without information and with written information decreased perceived fairness, personableness perception, and increased emotional creepiness. In turn, perceived fairness, personableness perceptions, and emotional creepiness mediated the association between an AI‐supported selection process, organizational attractiveness, and the intention to further proceed with the selection process. Moreover, results did not differ for applicants who were provided video explanations of the benefits of AI‐supported selection tools and those who participated in an actual human selection process. Important implications for research and practice are discussed.

ID-066,article,The “humane in the loop”: Inclusive research design and policy approaches to foster capacity building assistive technologies in the COVID-19 era,"The COVID-19 pandemic is emerging as a driver of greater reliance on wireless technologies, including intelligent assistive technologies, such as robots and artificial intelligence. We must integrate the humane “into the loop” of human-AT interactions to realize the full potential of wireless inclusion for people with disabilities and older adults. Embedding ethics into these new technologies is critical and requires a co-design approach, with end users participating throughout. Developing humane AT begins with a participatory, user-centered design embedded in an iterative co-creation process, and guided by an ethos prioritizing beneficence, user autonomy and agency. To gain insight into plausible AT development pathways (“futures”), we use scenario planning as a tool to articulate themes in the research literature. Four plausible scenarios are developed and compared to identify one as a desired “humane” future for AT development. Policy and practice recommendations derived from this scenario, and their implications for the role of AT in the advancement of human potential are explored.

ID-067,article,Why do users trust algorithms? A review and conceptualization of initial trust and trust over time,"Algorithms are increasingly playing a pivotal role in organizations' day-to-day operations; however, a general distrust of artificial intelligence-based algorithms and automated processes persists. This aversion to algorithms raises questions about the drivers that lead managers to trust or reject their use. This conceptual paper aims to provide an integrated review of how users experience the encounter with AI-based algorithms over time. This is important for two reasons: first, their functional activities change over the course of time through machine learning; and second, users' trust develops with their level of knowledge of a particular algorithm. Based on our review, we propose an integrative framework to explain how users’ perceptions of trust change over time. This framework extends current understandings of trust in AI-based algorithms in two areas: First, it distinguishes between the formation of initial trust and trust over time in AI-based algorithms, and specifies the determinants of trust in each phase. Second, it links the transition between initial trust in AI-based algorithms and trust over time to representations of the technology as either human-like or system-like. Finally, it considers the additional determinants that intervene during this transition phase.

ID-068,article,The searching artificial intelligence: Consumers show less aversion to algorithm‐recommended search product,"Though artificial intelligence (AI) recommendation is a hot topic in recent marketing research, previous research has shown a convergent tendency for aversion to AI recommendation. It is imperative to find ways to promote AI usage and reduce consumers’ AI aversion. This study fills this void by exploring the effect of AI (vs. human) recommenders on consumers’ preferences for search versus experience products in the context of e‐commerce. Two studies provide convergent evidence that consumers show less avoidance of algorithms when recommending search products compared to experience products. A behavioral experiment (Study 1, n = 26) shows that consumers have a higher level of cognitive conflict (i.e., a larger magnitude of N2) when AI (vs. human) recommends experience products, while the effect disappears for search products. This paper shows that for search products, marketers can obtain similar evaluations using AI recommenders, which is relatively cheaper and more time‐saving compared with human recommenders. Therefore, our work provides important implications for theory and practice on e‐commerce and marketing communication.

ID-069,article,Buffer bots: The role of virtual service agents in mitigating negative effects when service fails,"In recent years, marketers have placed increased reliance upon artificial intelligence (AI) and, subsequently, the use of virtual agents in customer service contexts is on the rise. Despite such service digitalization, service can still fail. While there is an increasing literature on the effect of virtual agents in service settings, questions remain as to how customers react to service failure that results from interactions with virtual service agents. To this end, we deconstruct the effect of virtual agent service failure across two studies: one involving a process service failure and another involving an outcome service failure. We specifically manipulate the type of service agent that causes the service failure (human vs. virtual agent) and the magnitude of the failure (small vs. large). Results show that firms can leverage virtual service agents to mitigate or buffer the negative effects of service failure. From a managerial perspective, our findings suggest that firms could engage virtual service agents in situations where there may be a risk of outcome service failure—particularly in settings where relatively large magnitude failures may be experienced. In such a setting, we find that virtual service agents can mitigate the negative effects of service failure, more so than when the failure results from an interaction with a human service agent.

ID-070,article,Visions of artificial intelligence and robots in science fiction: A computational analysis,"Driven by the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and anthropomorphic robotic systems, the various possibilities and risks of such technologies have become a topic of urgent discussion. Although science fiction (SF) works are often cited as references for visions of future developments, this framework of discourse may not be appropriate for serious discussions owing to technical inaccuracies resulting from its reliance on entertainment media. However, these science fiction works could help researchers understand how people might react to new AI and robotic systems. Hence, classifying depictions of artificial intelligence in science fiction may be expected to help researchers to communicate more clearly by identifying science fiction elements to which their works may be similar or dissimilar. In this study, we analyzed depictions of artificial intelligence in SF together with expert critics and writers. First, 115 AI systems described in SF were selected based on three criteria, including diversity of intelligence, social aspects, and extension of human intelligence. Nine elements representing their characteristics were analyzed using clustering and principal component analysis. The results suggest the prevalence of four distinctive categories, including human-like characters, intelligent machines, helpers such as vehicles and equipment, and infrastructure, which may be mapped to a two-dimensional space with axes representing intelligence and humanity. This research contributes to the public relations of AI and robotic technologies by analyzing shared imaginative visions of AI in society based on SF works.

ID-071,article,Artificial intelligence-supported art education: A deep learning-based system for promoting university students’ artwork appreciation and painting outcomes,"ABSTRACT In a conventional art course, it is important for a teacher to provide feedback and guidance to individual students based on their learning status. However, it is challenging for teachers to provide immediate feedback to students without any aid. The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has provided a possible solution to cope with this problem. In this study, a deep learning-based art learning system (DL-ALS) was developed by employing a fine-tuned ResNet50 model for helping students identify and classify artworks. We aimed at cultivating students’ accurate appreciation knowledge and artwork creation competence, as well as providing instant feedback and personalized guidance with the help of AI technology. To explore the effects of this system, a quasi-experiment was implemented in an artwork appreciation course at a university. A total of 46 university students from two classes who took the elective art course were recruited in the study. One class was the experimental group adopting DL-ALS learning, while the other was the control group adopting conventional technology-supported art learning (CT-AL). The results showed that in comparison with CT-AL, learning through the DL-ALS could facilitate students’ learning achievement, technology acceptance, learning attitude, learning motivation, self-efficacy, satisfaction, and performance in the art course.

ID-072,article,Drivers of salespeople’s AI acceptance: What do managers think?,"This research is among the first to examine salespeople’s acceptance of AI (artificial intelligence) and we investigate the drivers of their AI acceptance from the perspective of the managers. In this study, we propose and empirically demonstrate that perceived ease of use, self-efficacy, perceived management support, and digitalization are positively related to salespeople’s acceptance of AI. Moreover, we show that digitalization mediates the relationship between salespeople’s prospecting/adaptive selling capabilities and their AI acceptance. The results suggest that in order to incentivize AI acceptance, managers need to build adequate digital infrastructure, cultivate organizational support to encourage AI adoption and usage, provide professional training to educate salespeople on the proper usage of AI, and reduce salespeople’s perceived risk of AI usage. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed subsequently.

ID-073,article,The effects of domain knowledge on trust in explainable AI and task performance: A case of peer-to-peer lending,"Increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to assist complex decision-making such as financial investing. However, there are concerns regarding the black-box nature of AI algorithms. The field of explainable AI (XAI) has emerged to address these concerns. XAI techniques can reveal how an AI decision is formed and can be used to understand and appropriately trust an AI system. However, XAI techniques still may not be human-centred and may not support human decision-making adequately. In this work, we explored how domain knowledge, identified by expert decision makers, can be used to achieve a more human-centred approach to AI. We measured the effect of domain knowledge on trust in AI, reliance on AI, and task performance in an AI-assisted complex decision-making environment. In a peer-to-peer lending simulator, non-expert participants made financial investments using an AI assistant. The presence or absence of domain knowledge was manipulated. The results showed that participants who had access to domain knowledge relied less on the AI assistant when the AI assistant was incorrect and indicated less trust in AI assistant. However, overall investing performance was not affected. These results suggest that providing domain knowledge can influence how non-expert users use AI and could be a powerful tool to help these users develop appropriate levels of trust and reliance.

ID-074,article,Artificial intelligence in psychology: How can we enable psychology students to accept and use artificial intelligence?,"Psychologists with their expertise in statistics and regarding human perception and behavior can contribute valuable insights to the development of innovative and useful artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Therefore, we need to raise attention and curiosity for AI and foster the willingness to engage with it among psychology students. This requires identifying approaches to integrate a general understanding of AI technology into formal psychological training and education. This study investigated to what extent psychology students currently accept and use AI and what affects their perception and usage. Therefore, an AI acceptance model based on established technology acceptance models was developed and tested in a sample of 218 psychology students. An acceptable fit with the data was found for an adapted version. Perceived usefulness and ease of use were most predictive for the students’ attitude towards AI; attitude itself, as well as perceived usefulness, social norm, and perceived knowledge, were predictors for the intention to use AI. In summary, we identified relevant factors for designing AI training approaches in psychology curricula. In this way, possible restraints regarding the use of AI can be reduced and its beneficial opportunities exploited in psychological contexts.",https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/artificial-intelligence-psychology-how-can-we/docview/2809151363/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Artificial+intelligence+in+psychology%3A+How+can+we+enable+psychology+students+to+accept+and+use+artificial+intelligence%3F&title=Psychology+Learning+%26+Teaching&issn=14757257&date=2022-03-01&volume=21&issue=1&spage=37&au=Gado%2C+Sabrina%3BKempen%2C+Regina%3BLingelbach%2C+Katharina%3BBipp%2C+Tanja&isbn=&jtitle=Psychology+Learning+%26+Teaching&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2022-26027-004&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F14757257211037149,3,,,,,,,Sabrina Gado and Regina Kempen and Katharina Lingelbach and Tanja Bipp,https://doi.org/10.1177/14757257211037149,"1475-7257, 1475-7257",1,Psychology Learning & Teaching,"3530:Curriculum & Programs & Teaching Methods,Adulthood (18 yrs & older),Artificial Intelligence,College Students,Empirical Study,Female,Human,Male,Psychology Education,Quantitative Study,Social Norms,Student Attitudes,Technology Acceptance,Technology acceptance models,article,artificial intelligence,psychology students",3,"Copyright - © 2021, The Author(s)",37-56,2809151363; 2022-26027-004,Sage Publications Symposion Publishing The Higher Education Academy Psychology Network,21,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/artificial-intelligence-psychology-how-can-we/docview/2809151363/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Artificial+intelligence+in+psychology%3A+How+can+we+enable+psychology+students+to+accept+and+use+artificial+intelligence%3F&title=Psychology+Learning+%26+Teaching&issn=14757257&date=2022-03-01&volume=21&issue=1&spage=37&au=Gado%2C+Sabrina%3BKempen%2C+Regina%3BLingelbach%2C+Katharina%3BBipp%2C+Tanja&isbn=&jtitle=Psychology+Learning+%26+Teaching&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2022-26027-004&rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F14757257211037149,2022,,
ID-075,article,Interactive design psychology and artificial intelligence-based innovative exploration of Anglo-American traumatic narrative literature,"The advent of the intelligence age has injected new elements into the development of literature. The synergic modification of Anglo-American (AAL) traumatic narrative (TN) literature by artificial intelligence (AI) technology and interactive design (ID) psychology will produce new possibilities in literary creation. First, by studying natural language processing (NLP) technology, this study proposes a modification language model (LM) based on the double-layered recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm and constructs an intelligent language modification system based on the improved LM model. The results show that the performance of the proposed model is excellent; only about 30% of the respondents like AAL literature; the lack of common cultural background, appreciation difficulties, and language barriers have become the main reasons for the decline of reading willingness of AAL literature. Finally, AI technology and ID psychology are used to modify a famous TN work respectively and synergically, and the modified work is appreciated by respondents to collect their comments. The results corroborate that 62% of the respondents like original articles, but their likability scores have decreased for individually modified work by AI or ID psychology. In comparison, under the synergic modification efforts of AI and ID psychology, the popularity of the modified work has increased slightly, with 65% of the respondents showing a likability to read. Therefore, it is concluded that literary modification by single ID psychology or AI technology will reduce the reading threshold by trading off the literary value of the original work.

ID-076,article,Home-tutoring services assisted with technology: Investigating the role of artificial intelligence using a randomized field experiment,"Despite a rising interest in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, research in services marketing has not evaluated its role in helping firms learn about customers’ needs and increasing the adaptability of service employees. Therefore, the authors develop a conceptual framework and investigate whether and to what extent providing AI assistance to service employees improves service outcomes. The randomized controlled trial in the context of tutoring services shows that helping service employees (tutors) adapt to students’ learning needs by providing AI-generated diagnoses significantly improves service outcomes measured by academic performance. However, the authors find that some tutors may not utilize AI assistance (i.e., AI aversion), and factors associated with unforeseen barriers to usage (i.e., technology overload) can moderate its impact on outcomes. Interestingly, tutors who significantly contribute to the firm's revenue relied heavily on AI assistance but unexpectedly benefited little from AI in improving service outcomes. Given the wide applicability of AI assistance in a variety of services marketing contexts, the authors suggest that firms should consider the potential difficulties employees face in using the technology rather than encourage them to use it as it is.

ID-077,inbook,"Intelligentia Dei: Artificial intelligence, human reason and divine wisdom","The study analyses the significance of religious language in avant-garde technological contexts. It turns out that even the top researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are very fond of resorting to theological terminology in order to explicate the outstanding importance of their achievements. They define ‘God as the most intelligent being imaginable’ and identify this with the high-performance computers currently being developed. AI thus acquires the character of a salvation event and becomes the final evolutionary step of true religion. The promise of divine intelligence functions—where will be shown in a second part—in contemporary advertising as a lure for mind-expanding techniques and psychotropic drugs. In contrast, biblical literature is very sober and realistic. As the third part shows, the Old Testament wisdom, with all its appreciation of human reason, critically clarifies its limits and functions as a warning against frivolous promises of salvation by AI and a hubris of humans that threatens to lose sight of the difference of human and the divine.

ID-079,article,When do you trust AI? The effect of number presentation detail on consumer trust and acceptance of AI recommendations,"When do consumers trust artificial intelligence (AI)? With the rapid adoption of AI technology in the field of marketing, it is crucial to understand how consumer adoption of the information generated by AI can be improved. This study explores a novel relationship between number presentation details associated with AI and consumers' behavioral and evaluative responses toward AI. We theorized that consumer trust would mediate the preciseness effect on consumer judgment and evaluation of the information provided by AI. The results of five studies demonstrated that the use of a precise (vs. imprecise) information format leads to higher evaluations and behavioral intentions. We also show mediational evidence indicating that the effect of number preciseness is mediated by consumer trust (Studies 2, 4, and 5). We further show that the preciseness effect is moderated by the accuracy of AI‐generated information (Study 3) and the objective product quality of the recommended products (Study 4). This study provides theoretical implications to the AI acceptance literature, the information processing literature, the consumer trust literature, and the decision‐making literature. Moreover, this study makes practical implications for marketers of AI businesses including those who strategically use AI‐generated information.

ID-080,article,Understanding the potential adoption of autonomous vehicles in China: The perspective of behavioral reasoning theory,"Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the most disruptive technologies to reduce road incidents, improve road efficiency and enhance mobility for underserved populations. However, existing literature of AV adoption is either based on descriptive analysis or simple applications of conventional behavioral frameworks. Drawing on behavioral reasoning theory (BRT), we examine the effect of reasoning process on consumers' attitudes and intentions toward adopting AVs, and how their psychological traits moderates the relationships. By conducting a nationwide survey in China (n = 849), we identify positive (negative) effects of individuals' reasons for (against) adopting AVs on their adoption intentions for AVs, and positive influence of face consciousness on the reasoning process. More importantly, we find that the psychological trait of need for uniqueness strengthens the association between consumers' reasoning for AVs and their adoption intention, while the risk aversion trait intensifies the negative relationships between consumers' reasoning against AVs and their attitude/adoption intention. We contribute to the literature of AI adoption by establishing the important roles of consumers' reasons for and against such innovations. We also extend the BRT framework by identifying the roles of psychological traits in moderating the relationships among reasoning, attitude, and adoption intention.

ID-081,article,Artificial intelligence coaches for sales agents: Caveats and solutions,"Firms are exploiting artificial intelligence (AI) coaches to provide training to sales agents and improve their job skills. The authors present several caveats associated with such practices based on a series of randomized field experiments. Experiment 1 shows that the incremental benefit of the AI coach over human managers is heterogeneous across agents in an inverted-U shape: whereas middle-ranked agents improve their performance by the largest amount, both bottom- and top-ranked agents show limited incremental gains. This pattern is driven by a learning-based mechanism in which bottom-ranked agents encounter the most severe information overload problem with the AI versus human coach, while top-ranked agents hold the strongest aversion to the AI relative to a human coach. To alleviate the challenge faced by bottom-ranked agents, Experiment 2 redesigns the AI coach by restricting the training feedback level and shows a significant improvement in agent performance. Experiment 3 reveals that the AI–human coach assemblage outperforms either the AI or human coach alone. This assemblage can harness the hard data skills of the AI coach and soft interpersonal skills of human managers, solving both problems faced by bottom- and top-ranked agents. These findings offer novel insights into AI coaches for researchers and managers alike.

ID-082,book,"The mind-technology problem: Investigating minds, selves and 21st century artefacts","This edited book deepens the engagement between 21st century philosophy of mind and the emerging technologies which are transforming our environment. Many new technologies appear to have important implications for the human mind, the nature of our cognition, our sense of identity and even perhaps what we think human beings are. They prompt questions such as: Would an uploaded mind be 'me'? Does our reliance on smart phones, or wearable gadgets enhance or diminish the human mind? and: How does our deep reliance upon ambient artificial intelligence change the shape of the human mind? Readers will discover the best philosophical analysis of what current and near future 21st technology means for the metaphysics of mind. Important questions are addressed on matters relating to the extended mind and the distributed self. Expert authors explore the role that the ubiquitous smart phone might have in creating new forms of self-knowledge. They consider machine consciousness, brain enhancement and smart ambient technology, and what they can tell us about phenomenal consciousness. While ideas of artificial general intelligence, cognitive enhancements and the smart environment are widely commented on, serious analysis of their philosophical implications is only getting started. These contributions from top scholars are therefore very timely, and are of particular relevance to students and scholars of the philosophy of mind, philosophy of technology, computer science and psychology.

ID-083,book,What makes us human: How minds develop through social interactions,"“How do you go from a bunch of cells to something that can think?” This question, asked by the 9-year-old son of one of the authors, speaks to a puzzle that lies at the heart of this book. How are we as humans able to explore such questions about our own origins, the workings of our mind, and more? In this fascinating volume, developmental psychologists Jeremy Carpendale and Charlie Lewis delve into how such human capacities for reflection and self-awareness pinpoint a crucial facet of human intelligence that sets us apart from closely related species and artificial intelligence. Richly illustrated with examples, including questions and anecdotes from their own children, they bring theories and research on children’s development alive. The accessible prose shepherds readers through scientific and philosophical debates, translating complex theories and concepts for psychologists and non-psychologists alike.",https://www.proquest.com/books/what-makes-us-human-how-minds-develop-through/docview/2604094223/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&genre=book&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=&title=What+makes+us+human%3A+How+minds+develop+through+social+interactions&issn=&date=2021-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Carpendale%2C+Jeremy%3BLewis%2C+Charlie&isbn=9780367537920&jtitle=&btitle=What+makes+us+human%3A+How+minds+develop+through+social+interactions&rft_id=info:eric/2021-07034-000&rft_id=info:doi/,4,,,,,,book,Jeremy Carpendale and Charlie Lewis,,,,What makes us human: How minds develop through social interactions,"3020:Group & Interpersonal Processes,Adolescence (13-17 yrs),Adulthood (18 yrs & older),Awareness,Childhood (birth-12 yrs),Female,Human,Intelligence,Male,Mind,Morality,Psychology: Professional & Research,Social Interaction,Social Processes,book,human capacities,human intelligence,minds,morality,reflection,self-awareness,social interactions,social processes",,Date revised - 20211129,"234-Chapter xi, 234 Pages",2604094223; 2021-07034-000,Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group,,https://www.proquest.com/books/what-makes-us-human-how-minds-develop-through/docview/2604094223/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:book&genre=book&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=&title=What+makes+us+human%3A+How+minds+develop+through+social+interactions&issn=&date=2021-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Carpendale%2C+Jeremy%3BLewis%2C+Charlie&isbn=9780367537920&jtitle=&btitle=What+makes+us+human%3A+How+minds+develop+through+social+interactions&rft_id=info:eric/2021-07034-000&rft_id=info:doi/,2021,"New York, NY",
ID-084,inbook,Artificial intelligence in mental health,"Mental health is at a critical impasse. The first big data wave occurred over a decade ago, fueled by the reduced cost of-omics techniques (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics), increased access to neuroimaging equipment, and the transition to electronic medical records (EMRs). Solutions are desperately needed to resolve current bottlenecks in the translational pathway. Factors contributing to delays in discoveries progressing to implementation include: nosology conflicts and illness heterogeneity; reliance on P-values as the primary determinant of study significance; limitations of traditional statistics with large, multidimensional data sets; lessening participation in population-based research; limited utility of EMR data; and Lack of objective measures for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Mental health providers are at a heightened increased risk for emotional exhaustion, hazards that contribute to clinician burnout. Although more individuals are pursuing help than ever before, many of the most vulnerable individuals never seek care prior to an adverse outcome, such as suicide. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds substantial promise in addressing these and other critical issues within the field. A recent survey of psychiatrists found that only about 50% believe that AI will significantly transform clinical practice, which may reflect a healthy cynicism born of thwarted expectations of past overhyped technologies.

ID-085,article,Saudi international students’ perceptions of the utility of artificial intelligence and intelligent personal assistant tools in EFL learning,"Advancement in digital technology has resulted in the development of Artificial Intelligence systems, which have found numerous applications in various fields such as economics and engineering. The field of education has also not been left behind in terms of AI adoption. Although the literature illustrates the effectiveness of AI adoption in English as a Foreign Language (EFL learning), there is a scarcity of research on the perception of Saudi students towards AI adoption in EFL learning. Therefore, the current research investigated the perception of Saudi students towards AI usage in EFL learning, and how perception affects their acceptance of AI in EFL learning. Perception was broken down into several independent variables, which include performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions while the dependent variable was the frequency of AI usage in EFL learning. The researcher adopted a quantitative cross-section and non-experimental research design to achieve the study objectives. The study sample consisted of 382 Saudi students drawn from various institutions in the United States. Purposive sampling was used to select the sample, and the UTUAT model was used to generate a questionnaire for data collection. Finally, a linear regression model was adopted to determine the association between perception and AI acceptance in EFL learning. The obtained performance expectancy score, facilitating conditions score, and social influence score was 4 of 6 while the effort expectancy score was 5 of 6. It was also noted that the response regarding facilitating conditions in utilizing AI in EFL differed by gender. The study determined that only performance expectancy and social influence significantly predict the variation in the use of AI personal assistants in EFL learning. Therefore, to increase the frequency of using AI personal assistants in EFL learning among Saudi students, developers need to improve the components of the tools that directly enhance performance expectancies. Additionally, it is possible to generalize findings from this study considering the study sample did not only observe gender balance but was also drawn from diverse institutions in the United States.

ID-086,article,Artificial intelligence for clinical decision support in neurology,"Artificial intelligence is one of the most exciting methodological shifts in our era. It holds the potential to transform healthcare as we know it, to a system where humans and machines work together to provide better treatment for our patients. It is now clear that cutting edge artificial intelligence models in conjunction with high-quality clinical data will lead to improved prognostic and diagnostic models in neurological disease, facilitating expert-level clinical decision tools across healthcare settings. Despite the clinical promise of artificial intelligence, machine and deep-learning algorithms are not a one-size-fits-all solution for all types of clinical data and questions. In this article, we provide an overview of the core concepts of artificial intelligence, particularly contemporary deep-learning methods, to give clinician and neuroscience researchers an appreciation of how artificial intelligence can be harnessed to support clinical decisions. We clarify and emphasize the data quality and the human expertise needed to build robust clinical artificial intelligence models in neurology. As artificial intelligence is a rapidly evolving field, we take the opportunity to iterate important ethical principles to guide the field of medicine is it moves into an artificial intelligence enhanced future.

ID-087,article,How to be helpful to multiple people at once,"When someone hosts a party, when governments choose an aid program, or when assistive robots decide what meal to serve to a family, decision‐makers must determine how to help even when their recipients have very different preferences. Which combination of people’s desires should a decision‐maker serve? To provide a potential answer, we turned to psychology: What do people think is best when multiple people have different utilities over options? We developed a quantitative model of what people consider desirable behavior, characterizing participants’ preferences by inferring which combination of “metrics” (maximax, maxsum, maximin, or inequality aversion [IA]) best explained participants’ decisions in a drink-choosing task. We found that participants’ behavior was best described by the maximin metric, describing the desire to maximize the happiness of the worst-off person, though participant behavior was also consistent with maximizing group utility (the maxsum metric) and the IA metric to a lesser extent. Participant behavior was consistent across variation in the agents involved and  tended to become more maxsum-oriented when participants were told they were players in the task (Experiment 1). In later experiments, participants maintained maximin behavior across multi-step tasks rather than shortsightedly focusing on the individual steps therein (Experiment 2, Experiment 3). By repeatedly asking participants what choices they would hope for in an optimal, just decision-maker, and carefully disambiguating which quantitative metrics describe these nuanced choices, we help constrain the space of what behavior we desire in leaders, artificial intelligence systems helping decision-makers, and the assistive robots and decision-makers of the future.",https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/how-be-helpful-multiple-people-at-once/docview/2439652658/se-2?accountid=14026 http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=How+to+be+helpful+to+multiple+people+at+once&title=Cognitive+Science&issn=03640213&date=2020-06-01&volume=44&issue=6&spage=&au=Gates%2C+Vael%3BGriffiths%2C+Thomas+L.%3BDragan%2C+Anca+D.&isbn=&jtitle=Cognitive+Science&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2020-37130-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fcogs.12841,3,,,,,,,Vael Gates and Thomas L Griffiths and Anca D Dragan,https://doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12841,"0364-0213, 0364-0213",6,Cognitive Science,"2340:Cognitive Processes,Adulthood (18 yrs & older),Artificial Intelligence,Assistive Technology,Assistive artificial intelligence,Decision Making,Decision Support Systems,Decision Theory,Empirical Study,Fairness,Human,Inference,Maximin,Modeling,Preferences,Quantitative Study,US,article",6,"Copyright - © 2020, Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

ID-088,article,Psychosocial factors affecting artificial intelligence adoption in health care in China: Cross-sectional study,"Background: Poor quality primary health care is a major issue in China, particularly in blindness prevention. Artificial intelligence (AI) could provide early screening and accurate auxiliary diagnosis to improve primary care services and reduce unnecessary referrals, but the application of AI in medical settings is still an emerging field. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the general public’s acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices, with reference to those already used in China, and the interrelated influencing factors that shape people’s intention to use these devices. Methods: We proposed a model of ophthalmic AI acceptance based on technology acceptance theories and variables from other health care–related studies. The model was verified via a 32-item questionnaire with 7-point Likert scales completed by 474 respondents (nationally random sampled). Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate item and construct reliability and validity via a confirmatory factor analysis, and the model’s path effects, significance, goodness of fit, and mediation and moderation effects were analyzed. Results: Standardized factor loadings of items were between 0.583 and 0.876. Composite reliability of 9 constructs ranged from 0.673 to 0.841. The discriminant validity of all constructs met the Fornell and Larcker criteria. Model fit indicators such as standardized root mean square residual (0.057), comparative fit index (0.915), and root mean squared error of approximation (0.049) demonstrated good fit.

ID-089,article,"Stay back, clever thing! Linking situational control and human uniqueness concerns to the aversion against autonomous technology","As artificial intelligence advances towards unprecedented levels of competence, people's acceptance of autonomous technology has become a hot topic among psychology and HCI scholars. Previous studies suggest that threat perceptions—regarding observers' immediate physical safety (proximal) as well as their more abstract concepts of human uniqueness (distal)—impede the positive reception of self-controlled digital systems. Developing a Model of Autonomous Technology Threat, we propose both of these threat forms as common antecedents of users' general threat experience, which ultimately predicts reduced technology acceptance. In a laboratory study, 125 participants were invited to interact with a virtual reality agent, assuming it to be the embodiment of a fully autonomous personality assessment system. In a path analysis, we found correlational support for the proposed model, as both situational control and human uniqueness attitudes predicted threat experience, which in turn connected to stronger aversion against the presented system. Other potential state and trait influences are discussed.

ID-090,book,Leading and managing change in the age of disruption and artificial intelligence,"Whilst there has been considerable change to organisations in the last 30 years, a new age of change is ahead. It is now evident that the resulting change will be faster, more complex and less predictable than in the past. The dynamic of organisational change will have implications for the way leaders build organisations, teams and business plans, as the change ahead will be assisted by globalisation. This book is for those in leadership and management roles of the future, where the issues ahead will be immediate and broad. It is written in a way that is relevant to managing and leading irrespective of one's technical or functional background. The book is useful to those in a variety of management roles of many functions including medicine, operations, engineering, finance or many other backgrounds. Some industries may be more exposed to the artificial intelligence (AI) than disruption, especially where the roles are repeatable, labour intensive or require precision and fast knowledge. The topics covered are useful for students studying management, leadership, change, economics, accounting, engineering, human resources and many others. Future and current organisational leadership and management will benefit from the appreciation and critique of modern events in this book, where critical thinking is included. Organisations will likely be impacted by disruption and the AI in the future, where preparation and appreciation of these phenomena are relevant to organisational survival irrespective of organisational type or size. The book is unique on the market as it provides the broad knowledge of leadership and management topics in the context of organisational change in the new age. Included herein are tools, tables and analysis that may assist the student and the experienced manager prepare organisations for the future.

ID-091,article,Inequality signals in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex inform social preference models,"Humans typically display inequality aversion in social situations, which manifests itself as a preference for fairer distributions of resources. However, people differ in the degree to which they dislike being worse off [disadvantageous inequality (DI) aversion] or better off [advantageous inequality (AI) aversion] than others. Competing models explain such behavior by focusing on aversion to payoff differences, maximization of total payoff or reciprocity. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, we asked which of these theories could better explain dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity while participants accepted or punished fair vs unfair monetary transfers in an anonymous norm compliance task. We found that while all participants exhibited DI aversion, there were substantial differences in preferences for AI, which were strongly predicted by dlPFC activation. Model comparisons revealed that both punishment behavior and prefrontal activity were best explained by a model that allowed for AI seeking rather than imposing aversion. Moreover, enhancing this model by taking into account behavioral response times, as a proxy for choice difficulty, further improved model fits. Our data provide evidence that the dlPFC encodes subjective values of payoff inequality and that this representation is richer than envisaged by standard models of social preferences.

ID-092,article,A longitudinal exploration of advantageous and disadvantageous inequality aversion in children,"Unfairness in resource allocation situations can present itself in two ways, with one person receiving either less or more than another person. Research suggests that aversion to situations of disadvantageous inequality (DI), in which a child receives less than a peer, develops differently from aversion to advantageous inequality (AI), in which a child receives more than a partner. However, little is known about how AI aversion and DI aversion develop as well as how the relationship between the two may change over time. In this short-term longitudinal study, two forms of AI and DI (in which equality was either costly or not costly) were examined. Using a forced choice resource allocation task, children’s decision making was compared across three time points: 4.5, 5.0, and 5.5 years of age. In both AI and DI situations, costly and no-cost trials were correlated at each time point, establishing construct validity within trial types. A positive relationship (indicating a preference for fairness) was observed between AI and DI at Time 1, whereas no relationships were observed later in development. Finally, correlations across all time points were observed in AI trials and grew stronger with age, whereas only one relationship was observed (between Time 1 and Time 2) in DI trials. Taken together, these results suggest that decision making in situations of AI and DI develops differently and that the relationship between them changes with age. Importantly, this research suggests that motivations for fairness and equality differ depending on context, and an undifferentiated aversion to inequality is not primarily guiding decision making throughout childhood.

ID-093,article,Overlapping and distinct representations of advantageous and disadvantageous inequality,"Advantageous inequality (AI) aversion, or paying at a personal cost to achieve equal reward distribution, represents a unique feature of human behavior. Here, we show that individuals have strong preferences for fairness in both disadvantageous (DI) and advantageous inequality (AI) situations, such that they alter others' payoff at a personal financial cost. At the neural level, we found that both types of inequality activated the putamen, orbitofrontal cortex, and insula, regions implicated in motivation. Individual difference analyses found that those who spent more money to increase others' payoff had stronger activity in putamen when they encountered AI and less functional connectivity between putamen and both orbitofrontal cortex and anterior insula. Conversely, those who spent more money to reduce others' payoff had stronger activity in amygdala in response to DI and less functional connectivity between amygdala and ventral anterior cingulate cortex. These dissociations suggest that both types of inequality are processed by similar brain areas, yet modulated by different neural pathways.

ID-095,article,Do American Indian mascots = American Indian people? Examining implicit bias towards American Indian people and American Indian mascots,"Empirical examinations of American Indian (AI) mascots have only recently entered into the discourse of mainstream psychology. The present studies examined implicit attitudes of non-AI people towards AI mascots and the extent to which they are related to attitudes towards AI people. Significant concordance was observed between negative bias toward AI mascots and AI people. Negative AI mascot bias also predicted stereotype-consistent expectations of an AI person. The implications of these findings are discussed.

ID-096,inbook,Personal information management,"Personal Information Management (PIM) refers to both the practice and the study of the activities a person performs in order to acquire or create, organize, maintain, retrieve, use, and distribute the information needed to complete tasks (work-related and not) and to fulfill various roles and responsibilities (as parent, employee, friend, member of community, etc.). PIM places special emphasis on the manipulation of information as packaged into information items such as paper documents, electronic documents, email messages, Web references, handwritten notes, appointments entered in a calendar, and so on. PIM shares considerable, potentially synergistic overlap with disciplines such as cognitive science, human-computer interaction, information science, artificial intelligence, database management, and information retrieval. This chapter reviews PIM in the context of cognitive science and the study of human cognition. Even in this narrower context, the extent of common ground can easily overwhelm. For example, the way people process and manage information varies greatly depending upon the current task and their familiarity with or training in its completion. A person's practice of PIM can change dramatically over time and is heavily influenced by an external environment that includes other people, available technology, and organizational setting. Consequently, the study of situated cognition, distributed cognition, and social cognition (e.g., Suchman 1987; Fiske & Taylor 1991; Hutchins 1994) all have relevance to the study of PIM. Also highly relevant is the study of affordances provided by the environment and by the ""everyday"" (and often overlooked) objects of a person's environment (Gibson 1977, 1979; Norman 1988, 1990, 1993). People vary greatly in their approach to PIM-relevant behaviors such as planning and with respect to personality traits such as risk-aversion--making the study of individual differences and personality also relevant.

ID-097,article,Competing for Reality,"In this article, we will apply aspects of Rychlak's philosophy of science to some of the most important issues in psychology today (issues of brain versus behavior, genetic destiny, the nature of scientific investigation, ecopsychology, and artificial intelligence). In our discussion of these issues, we attempt to show the ways that an appreciation of Rychlak's views can help conceptualize the bases of the disagreements in the field as well as explain why so many psychologists tend to ""talk past"" as opposed to ""talk to"" one another. We believe that a greater appreciation of Rychlak's major theses could allow psychologists to respect the work of others instead of trying to assert politically their favorite truth claims.

ID-098,book,Who needs emotions?: The brain meets the robot,"The aim of this book is to represent the state of the art in both the evolutionary analysis of neural mechanisms of emotion (as well as motivation and affect) in animals as a basis for a deeper understanding of such mechanisms in the human brain as well as the progress of AI in creating the appearance or the reality of emotion in robots and other machines. Part I highlights the differences of opinion that characterize the present dialog concerning the nature of emotion. Part II provides an evolutionary perspective on the neurochemical networks encoding emotion and motivation. Part III contributes to the general analysis of a cognitive architecture of relevance both to psychological theorizing and to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in general, and robots in particular. Part IV offers conclusions from the editors. The book brings together the state of the art of research in the neuroscience and AI approaches to emotion in an effort to understand why humans and other animals have emotion and the various ways that emotion may factor into robotics and cognitive architectures of the future. The editors hope that through an appreciation of different views, readers will gain their own comprehensive understanding of why humans have emotion and the extent to which robots should and will have them.

A critical mass of research in this narrower field has only come into acknowledged existence after coordination initiatives (journal special issues as well as workshops) were undertaken for the very purpose of either bootstrapping the emergence of this subarea within ""AI & Law,"" or then to wean the extant debate among legal theorists from its exclusive focus on probabilities in law. In this introductory article to the present special issue, we take a walk through various foci for debate which are relevant for a better appreciation of the state of the art.

ID-100,article,Agent-based simulation in the study of social dilemmas,"Reviews agent-based social simulation (ABSS) in relation to the study of social dilemmas such as the Prisoner's Dilemma and Tragedy of the Commons. The authors explore the place of ABSS in relation to other research methods such as mathematical analysis, familiarize artificial intelligence researchers (particularly those working on multi-agent systems) with a body of relevant multidisciplinary work, and suggest directions for future ABSS research on social dilemmas. ABSS research can contribute greatly to the understanding of social phenomena, but needs to be based on a clear appreciation of the current ""state of play"" in the areas where it is used. With regard to ""thin"" (simple, general) simulation models, this primarily means attending to what has been or could be discovered by mathematical analysis, to work using other forms of simulation, and to the relevant theoretical disputes; with regard to ""thick"" (specific, detailed) models, linking to the relevant thin models and to the empirical evidence. It is argued that the bulk of ABSS work on social dilemmas has been concentrated in quite a narrow area, and has sometimes been seriously flawed by over-ambitious claims, and insufficient attention to analytical approaches.

ID-101,book,Representation and processing of spatial expressions,"Coping with spatial expressions in a cognitively plausible way is a crucial problem in a number of research fields, in particular, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, psychology, and linguistics. This volume contains both a set of theoretical analyses and accounts of applications that deal with the problems of representing and processing of spatial expressions. Though there have been many different approaches to the representation and processing of spatial expressions, most existing computational characterizations have so far been restricted to particularly narrow problem domains, usually specific spatial contexts determined by overall system goals. To date, artificial intelligence research in this field has rarely taken advantage of studies of language and spatial cognition carried out by the cognitive science community. One of the fundamental aims of this book is to bring together research from both disciplines in the belief that artificial intelligence has much to gain from an appreciation of cognitive theories.

ID-105,article,,"Purpose: In spite of the merits of artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing and social media, harm to consumers has prompted calls for AI auditing/certification. Understanding consumers' approval of AI certification entities is vital for its effectiveness and companies' choice of certification. This study aims to generate important insights into the consumer perspective of AI certifications and stimulate future research. Design/methodology/approach: A literature and status-quo-driven search of the AI certification landscape identifies entities and related concepts. This study empirically explores consumer approval of the most discussed entities in four AI decision domains using an online experiment and outline a research agenda for AI certification in marketing/social media. Findings: Trust in AI certification is complex. The empirical findings show that consumers seem to approve more of non-profit entities than for-profit entities, with the government approving the most. Research limitations/implications: The introduction of AI certification to marketing/social media contributes to work on consumer trust and AI acceptance and structures AI certification research from outside marketing to facilitate future research on AI certification for marketing/social media scholars. Practical implications: For businesses, the authors provide a first insight into consumer preferences for AI-certifying entities, guiding the choice of which entity to use. For policymakers, this work guides their ongoing discussion on ""who should certify AI"" from a consumer perspective. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the first to introduce the topic of AI certification to the marketing/social media literature, provide a novel guideline to scholars and offer the first set of empirical studies examining consumer approval of AI certifications.

ID-107,article,Artificial intelligence and ChatGPT: Exploring Current and potential future roles in marketing education.,"Amid growing concerns about use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered technologies like ChatGPT by students and researchers, this paper provides a brief overview of AI, focusing primarily on ChatGPT as one example of a chatbot that can perform various human-like functions. We discuss the utility of AI in the advertising and marketing communications industries and education. We also address fear, uncertainty, and risk-aversion for the use of these technologies in education and scholarship. We argue in favor of embracing AI in advertising and marketing communications education and practice while also providing suggested guidelines for best practices and a deep understanding of the challenges and ethical concerns associated with such uses. The paper concludes with a suggested agenda for pioneering research in this area. This paper is not intended to provide an exhaustive summary of all existing research on AI. Rather, it is a thought piece intended to stimulate curiosity among educators and practitioners and encourage further research among advertising scholars.

ID-108,article,Beyond humans: Consumer reluctance to adopt zoonotic artificial intelligence.,"In addition to humanoid‐robotic designs, an increasing number of artificial intelligence (AI)‐powered services are being represented by animals, referred to as zoonotic design. Yet, little is known about the consequential effects of such zoonotic AI on consumer adoption of these services. Drawing on the concepts of prototypicality, Cognitive Load Theory, and the ""Match‐up"" Hypothesis, the current research uncovers how the use of zoonotic designs, as opposed to robotic ones, may negatively influence consumers' adoption of AI over a human provider. The results of seven studies suggest that consumers are less likely to choose an AI over a human provider for performing tasks when the AI has a zoonotic embodiment rather than a robotic embodiment. This negative effect is mediated by the increased cognitive difficulty associated with linking the AI prototype to the task. However, such a negative effect decreases when the characteristics of the animal are congruent with the task and is even reversed when the congruent task is of a hedonic nature. These findings advance the understanding of consumer–AI interactions in the context of zoonotic embodiment and provide valuable managerial insights into when and how firms should use zoonotic design for AI‐powered services.

ID-109,article,Buffer bots: The role of virtual service agents in mitigating negative effects when service fails.,"In recent years, marketers have placed increased reliance upon artificial intelligence (AI) and, subsequently, the use of virtual agents in customer service contexts is on the rise. Despite such service digitalization, service can still fail. While there is an increasing literature on the effect of virtual agents in service settings, questions remain as to how customers react to service failure that results from interactions with virtual service agents. To this end, we deconstruct the effect of virtual agent service failure across two studies: one involving a process service failure and another involving an outcome service failure. We specifically manipulate the type of service agent that causes the service failure (human vs. virtual agent) and the magnitude of the failure (small vs. large). Results show that firms can leverage virtual service agents to mitigate or buffer the negative effects of service failure. From a managerial perspective, our findings suggest that firms could engage virtual service agents in situations where there may be a risk of outcome service failure—particularly in settings where relatively large magnitude failures may be experienced. In such a setting, we find that virtual service agents can mitigate the negative effects of service failure, more so than when the failure results from an interaction with a human service agent.

ID-110,article,Can ChatGPT improve communication in hospitals?,"Hospitals’ use of communication is a crucial aspect of patient care, yet medical material is often hard to read and understand for patients. Issues related to lack of standardization, use of jargon, reliance on outdated technology, poor coordination between health personnel, and shortage of healthcare workers lead to miscommunication, delays, and errors in patient care. By improving communication, hospitals can improve patient care and outcomes, and perhaps lower costs. This opinion piece compares current communication methods with the use of ChatGPT technology to explore whether ChatGPT can improve the efficiency and accuracy of communication in healthcare settings and, hence, improve patient care. While natural language processing (NLP) tools such as ChatGPT and other artificial-intelligence-generated content (AIGC) have tremendous potential to be very useful in healthcare, they should not be solely used as a substitute for humans and should therefore be used with caution.

ID-111,article,Citizens' acceptance of artificial intelligence in public services: Evidence from a conjoint experiment about processing permit applications.,"Citizens' acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) in public service delivery is important for its legitimate and effective use by government. Human involvement in AI systems has been suggested as a way to boost citizens' acceptance and perceptions of these systems' fairness. However, there is little empirical evidence to assess these claims. To address this gap, we conducted a pre-registered conjoint experiment in the UK regarding acceptance of AI in processing public permits: for immigration visas and parking permits. We hypothesise that greater human involvement boosts acceptance of AI in decision-making and associated perceptions of its fairness. We further hypothesise that greater human involvement mitigates the negative impact of certain AI features, such as inaccuracy, high cost, or data sharing. From our study, we find that more human involvement tends to increase acceptance, and that perceptions of fairness were less influenced. Yet, when substantial human discretion was introduced in parking permit scenarios, respondents preferred more limited human input. We found little evidence that human involvement moderates the impact of AI's unfavourable attributes. System-level factors such as high accuracy, the presence of an appeals system, increased transparency, reduced cost, non-sharing of data, and the absence of private company involvement all boost both acceptance and perceived procedural fairness. We find limited evidence that individual characteristics affect these results. The findings show how the design of AI systems can increase its acceptability to citizens for use in public services. • In public service, more human input boosts AI acceptance and its perceived fairness. • High human administrative discretion can decrease preference for human involvement. • Cost and accuracy of technology matter more for acceptance than human involvement. • Citizens with low tendency to adopt technologies prefer greater human involvement. • Citizens' knowledge about AI does not alter acceptance of technology.

ID-112,article,Comprehending Behaviors of the Consumer in the Industry 4.0 Revolution: A Research on Smartphone Brands*.,"Today, when technology transforms and changes in such a way, a great difference is observed in the behaviors of consumers. Each innovation that is experienced in the world of technology, leads to the transformation of consumers’ perceptions to the same extent and this transformation is felt in every aspect of life. The revolution of Industry 4.0 that involves the life of consumers with its technological aspects, consists of the conglomeration of the innovations that are happened in the technological period and the adaptation of quite many new technologies to the industrial field in digital life. Based on all this information, the research seeks to reveal whether the external factors affecting the acceptance of augmented reality and artificial intelligence applications, show any alteration in the consumers using the different smartphone brands. For this purpose, the survey form, the reliability, and validity of which were ensured, was applied to 499 people. SPSS 21.0 and AMOS 22.0 packaged software were used in the analysis of the data gathered within the scope of this research. As a result of the analysis made, differences were observed in terms of the usages of smartphone brands discussed within the scope of this research by consumers in each variable of perceived ease of use, perceived benefit, perceived quality, intention to use, and usage behavior.

ID-113,article,Exploring consumers' response to text-based chatbots in e-commerce: the moderating role of task complexity and chatbot disclosure.,"Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots have brought unprecedented business potential. This study aims to explore consumers' trust and response to a text-based chatbot in e-commerce, involving the moderating effects of task complexity and chatbot identity disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: A survey method with 299 useable responses was conducted in this research. This study adopted the ordinary least squares regression to test the hypotheses. Findings: First, the consumers' perception of both the empathy and friendliness of the chatbot positively impacts their trust in it. Second, task complexity negatively moderates the relationship between friendliness and consumers' trust. Third, disclosure of the text-based chatbot negatively moderates the relationship between empathy and consumers' trust, while it positively moderates the relationship between friendliness and consumers' trust. Fourth, consumers' trust in the chatbot increases their reliance on the chatbot and decreases their resistance to the chatbot in future interactions. Research limitations/implications: Adopting the stimulus–organism–response (SOR) framework, this study provides important insights on consumers' perception and response to the text-based chatbot. The findings of this research also make suggestions that can increase consumers' positive responses to text-based chatbots. Originality/value: Extant studies have investigated the effects of automated bots' attributes on consumers' perceptions. However, the boundary conditions of these effects are largely ignored. This research is one of the first attempts to provide a deep understanding of consumers' responses to a chatbot.

ID-114,article,"Exploring News Innovations, Journalistic Routines, and Role Perceptions during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of Egyptian Journalists.","Drawing on in-depth interviews with 21 Egyptian journalists, this study offers a comprehensive understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic has reconfigured news work and journalistic routines in Egyptian newsrooms. In so doing, the paper examines the various technical and logistical challenges encountered by Egyptian journalists as well as their changing role perceptions during the emergency health crisis. It further investigates the innovative practices adopted by newsrooms, on both the news content and newsroom levels, to overcome those challenges in terms of sourcing norms, news production routines, and storytelling formats. Findings demonstrate that Egyptian journalists struggled at the beginning of the pandemic, but started to find creative solutions to overcome the many practical and infrastructural challenges. The pandemic accelerated the digitization of editorial news production systems and the unprecedented adoption of news automation and artificial intelligence technologies. More dependence on interactive digital storytelling formats and data visualization tools was reported. Journalistic innovation occurred therefore as recombination of already existing products or services, but not new inventions. In terms of role perception, there was a shift to a more facilitative role, in which science and more quantitatively oriented forms of journalism play a central role.

ID-115,article,,"Internet and social media have revolutionised the way news is distributed and consumed. However, the constant flow of massive amounts of content has made it difficult to discern between truth and falsehood, especially in online platforms plagued with malicious actors who create and spread harmful stories. Debunking disinformation is costly, which has put artificial intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, machine learning (ML) in the spotlight as a solution to this problem. This work revises recent literature on AI and ML techniques to combat disinformation, ranging from automatic classification to feature extraction, as well as their role in creating realistic synthetic content. We conclude that ML advances have been mainly focused on automatic classification and scarcely adopted outside research labs due to their dependence on limited-scope datasets. Therefore, research efforts should be redirected towards developing AI-based systems that are reliable and trustworthy in supporting humans in early disinformation detection instead of fully automated solutions.

ID-116,article,"Hot media, technological transformation and the plague of the dark emotions: Erich Fromm, Viktor Frankl and the recovery of meaning.","This article takes the position that our contemporary overheated media environment lends itself to comfortable passivity, resulting in mental breakdown in the guise of the dark emotions: anxiety, melancholia and boredom. This is especially the case with the inevitable synergy of the upcoming technological transformations from genetic modification, virtual reality simulacra and artificial intelligence/robotics. After discussing the data from the World Health Organization regarding the stark increase of people across the globe suffering from depression and anxiety, this article weds the concepts of McLuhan's hot–cool distinction with Fromm's delineation of the productive character orientation. Following Fromm, this article argues that joy ensues from reason, productive labour and love–sorrow from ignorance, alienated work and indifference. When we wilfully abrogate our responsibilities to self and other via non-participational mediated forms, we cede away our potential for growth and development. This leads to the emotional breakdowns of guilt, boredom, anxiety and melancholia. Viktor Frankl's logotherapeutic perspective is discussed as a counterbalance to the social effects wrought by our overheated technological environment. Frankl's stress on phenomenological meaning as the cornerstone of existence provides a lens to understanding the affects of an over-reliance on technological gadgetry.

ID-117,article,Investigating consumers' adoption of AI chatbots for apparel shopping.,"Purpose: Driven by Davis's (1989) technology acceptance model (TAM) and Westaby's (2005) behavioral reasoning theory (BRT), the purpose of this study is to develop and test a conceptual model and examine consumers' acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots for apparel shopping. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 353 eligible US respondents was collected through a self-administered questionnaire distributed on Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online panel. Confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis were used to test all hypothesized relationships using the structural equation model. Findings: The results show that optimism and relative advantage of ""reasons for"" dimensions have a positive and significant influence on perceived ease of use (PEU), while innovativeness and relative advantage have a positive and significant influence on perceived usefulness (PUF). Discomfort and insecurity have no significant impact on PEU and PUF. However, complexity has a negative and significant impact on PEU but not on PUF. Additionally, PEU has a positive influence on PUF. Both PEU and PUF have a positive and significant influence on consumers' attitudes toward using AI chatbots, which, in turn, affects the intention to use AI chatbots for apparel shopping. Overall, this study identifies that optimism, innovativeness and relative advantage are enablers and good reasons to adopt AI chatbots. Complexity is a prohibitor, making it the only reason against adopting AI chatbots for apparel shopping. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by integrating TAM and BRT to develop a research model to understand what ""reasons for"" and ""reasons against"" factors are enablers or prohibitors that significantly impact consumers' attitude and intention to use AI chatbots for apparel shopping through PEU and PUF.

ID-118,article,"Public perceptions on artificial intelligence driven disaster management: Evidence from Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.","• Investigates the public perceptions concerning AI use for disaster management. • Finds that younger generations have a greater appreciation of AI opportunities. • Finds that people with tertiary education have a greater understanding of AI benefits. • Finds that public sector administrative and safety workers place a greater value on AI. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly utilised in disaster management activities. The public is engaged with AI in various ways in these activities. For instance, crowdsourcing applications developed for disaster management to handle the tasks of collecting data through social media platforms, and increasing disaster awareness through serious gaming applications. Nonetheless, there are limited empirical investigations and understanding on public perceptions concerning AI for disaster management. Bridging this knowledge gap is the justification for this paper. The methodological approach adopted involved: Initially, collecting data through an online survey from residents (n = 605) of three major Australian cities; Then, analysis of the data using statistical modelling. The analysis results revealed that: (a) Younger generations have a greater appreciation of opportunities created by AI-driven applications for disaster management; (b) People with tertiary education have a greater understanding of the benefits of AI in managing the pre- and post-disaster phases, and; (c) Public sector administrative and safety workers, who play a vital role in managing disasters, place a greater value on the contributions by AI in disaster management. The study advocates relevant authorities to consider public perceptions in their efforts in integrating AI in disaster management.

ID-119,article,Reflection machines: increasing meaningful human control over Decision Support Systems.,"Rapid developments in Artificial Intelligence are leading to an increasing human reliance on machine decision making. Even in collaborative efforts with Decision Support Systems (DSSs), where a human expert is expected to make the final decisions, it can be hard to keep the expert actively involved throughout the decision process. DSSs suggest their own solutions and thus invite passive decision making. To keep humans actively 'on' the decision-making loop and counter overreliance on machines, we propose a 'reflection machine' (RM). This system asks users questions about their decision strategy and thereby prompts them to evaluate their own decisions critically. We discuss what forms RMs can take and present a proof-of-concept implementation of a RM that can produce feedback on users' decisions in the medical and law domains. We show that the prototype requires very little domain knowledge to create reasonably intelligent critiquing questions. With this prototype, we demonstrate the technical feasibility to develop RMs and hope to pave the way for future research into their effectiveness and value.

ID-120,article,Responsible reliance concerning development and use of AI in the military domain.,"In voicing commitments to the principle that the adoption of artificial-intelligence (AI) tools by armed forces should be done responsibly, a growing number of states have referred to a concept of “Responsible AI.” As part of an effort to help develop the substantive contours of that concept in meaningful ways, this position paper introduces a notion of “responsible reliance.” It is submitted that this notion could help the policy conversation expand from its current relatively narrow focus on interactions between an AI system and its end-user to also encompass the wider set of interdependencies involved in fulfilling legal obligations concerning the use of AI in armed conflicts. The authors argue that to respect international humanitarian law and ensure accountability, states ought to devise and maintain a framework that ensures that natural persons involved in the use an AI tool in an armed conflict could responsibly rely at least on: (1) the tool’s technical aspects, (2) the conduct of other people involved in development and use of that AI tool; and (3) the policies and processes implemented at the state level. According to the authors, the “responsible reliance” notion could serve, among other examples, as a basis on which to articulate legal requirements, prohibitions, and permissions across diverse areas, from the design of AI tools to human-machine interactions to configuration of responsible-command frameworks.

ID-121,article,Rule-based versus AI-driven benefits allocation: GDPR and AIA legal implications and challenges for automation in public social security administration.,"This article focuses on the legal implications of the growing reliance on automated systems in public administrations, using the example of social security benefits administration. It specifically addresses the deployment of automated systems for decisions on benefits eligibility within the frameworks of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). It compares how these two legal frameworks, each targeting different regulatory objects (personal data versus AI systems) and employing different protective measures, apply for two common system types: rule-based systems utilised for making fully automated decisions on eligibility, and machine learning AI systems utilised for assisting case administrators in their decision-making. It concludes on the combined impact that the GDPR and the AIA will have on each of these types of systems, as well as on differences in how these instruments determines the basic legality of utilising such systems within social security administration.

ID-122,article,Self-determination and attitudes toward artificial intelligence: Cross-national and longitudinal perspectives.,"• Two studies investigating attitudes toward AI based on the self-determination theory (SDT) and basic psychological needs. • Study 1 included data from Finland (N = 1541), France (N = 1561), Germany (N = 1529), Ireland (N = 1112), Italy (N = 1530), and Poland (N = 1533). • Study 2 was a longitudinal two-wave study from Finland (N = 827), examining change in AI attitudes over time. • Competence and relatedness were positively associated with AI positivity and all SDT dimensions were related to AI negativity in all countries. • Autonomy and relatedness increased AI positivity and decreased AI negativity over time. Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important in all domains of life. Therefore, it is crucial to understand individuals' attitudes towards AI. This article investigated attitudes toward AI through two studies that are based on the self-determination theory and basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness). Study 1 used cross-sectional samples of adult populations aged 18–75 from Finland (N = 1,541), France (N = 1,561), Germany (N = 1,529), Ireland (N = 1,112), Italy (N = 1,530), and Poland (N = 1,533). Study 2 was based on a longitudinal two-wave sample of adults aged 18–80 from Finland (N = 828). Based on the robust regression analyses, Study 1 found that fulfillment of basic psychological needs was associated with higher AI positivity and lower AI negativity across Europe. According to the Study 2 results, based on hybrid multilevel regression models, autonomy and relatedness increased AI positivity and decreased AI negativity over time. The results provide robust evidence on the role of self-determination in attitudes towards AI. Self-determination is an important factor in AI acceptance and is becoming increasingly important considering the rapid development and adoption of AI solutions.

ID-123,article,The effect of required warmth on consumer acceptance of artificial intelligence in service: The moderating role of AI-human collaboration.,"Recent technological advances allow artificial intelligence (AI) to perform tasks that require high warmth, such as caring, understanding others' feelings, and being friendly. However, current consumers may be reluctant to accept AI for such tasks. This research investigates the impact of required warmth to conduct a task on consumer acceptance of AI service and the moderating role of AI-human collaboration. A series of choice-based conjoint experiments and one survey yield two main findings. First, consumers tend to refuse AI for tasks that require high warmth due to the low perceived fit between AI and the task at hand. Second, an AI-human collaboration of AI supporting a human employee increases consumer acceptance of AI service for tasks that require high warmth. This is not the case for AI-human collaboration in which AI performs a task that is supervised by a human employee. Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of how consumer acceptance of AI service varies across tasks and how AI-human collaboration can advance AI acceptance. These findings provide insightful suggestions for managers regarding designing AI service and framing AI-human collaboration. • Required warmth decreases consumer acceptance of AI service. • Task-AI fit mediates the effect of required warmth. • AI supporting humans increases AI acceptance for tasks of high warmth. • AI supervised by humans cannot increase AI acceptance for tasks of high warmth.

ID-124,article,The possibility of deliberate norm-adherence in AI.,"Moral agency status is often given to those individuals or entities which act intentionally within a society or environment. In the past, moral agency has primarily been focused on human beings and some higher-order animals. However, with the fast-paced advancements made in artificial intelligence (AI), we are now quickly approaching the point where we need to ask an important question: should we grant moral agency status to AI? To answer this question, we need to determine the moral agency status of these entities in society. In this paper I argue that to grant moral agency status to an entity, deliberate norm-adherence must be possible (at a minimum). In this paper I argue that, under the current status quo, AI systems are unable to meet this criterion. The novel contribution this paper makes to the field of machine ethics is first, to provide at least two criteria with which we can determine moral agency status. We do this by determining the possibility of deliberate norm-adherence through examining the possibility of deliberate norm-violation. Second, to show that establishing moral agency in AI suffer the same pitfalls as establishing moral agency in constitutive accounts of agency.

ID-125,article,The precursors of AI adoption in business: Towards an efficient decision-making and functional performance.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a highly effective solution for enhancing decision-making efficiency and optimising the functional performance of organisations. However, there have been limited attempts to assess the consequences of implementing AI systems on the quality and efficiency of decision-making. This study proposes and empirically examines an extended model covering all aspects that would shape the successful adoption of AI by decision-makers while investigating how the successful adoption of AI enhances the efficiency of the decision-making process. This study also intends to test the validity of the integrated AI acceptance-avoidance model (IAAAM) proposed by Cao et al. (2021) using the Middle East context (i.e. Saudi Arabia). The extended model of the current study was based on the IAAAM and IS professional distinctiveness (ISPD). Two quantitative studies were conducted to achieve the research objectives. The first study was conducted to validate the IAAAM using a purposive sample of employees (non-adopters of AI applications). The second study tested the proposed model using a purposive sample of employees (actual adopters). The structural equation modelling (SEM) results of the first study (non-adopters) supported the validity of the IAAAM in Saudi Arabia. Factors (performance expectancy (PE), facilitating conditions (FC), personal well-being concern (PWC), perceived threat (PT), and attitudes (ATT)) had a significant impact on either ATT or the intention to use AI. The SEM results of actual adopters supported the impact of PE, EE, FC, PWC, and ATT on either ATT or the adoption of AI (AoAI). As an external factor, the ISPD was the most significant predictor of AoAI. The AoAI was confirmed to strongly predict decision-making efficiency, which, in turn, contributes to functional performance. This study enriches the current understanding of the main factors that contribute to the successful implementation of AI systems, offering an in-depth understanding of both AI adopters and non-adopters. It identifies factors important to non-users to enhance future adoption, whereas current AI users focus on improving decision-making quality with the AI assistance. • Examining aspects that would shape the successful adoption of AI by decision makers. • Impact of successful adoption of AI on the efficiency of the decision making process. • Testing the integrated AI acceptance-avoidance model (IAAAM) in Middle East context. • An extended model was built based on IAAAM and IS professional distinctiveness (ISPD). • Two quantitative studies were done to test IAAAM and extended model of the current study.

ID-127,article,The searching artificial intelligence: Consumers show less aversion to algorithm‐recommended search product.,"Though artificial intelligence (AI) recommendation is a hot topic in recent marketing research, previous research has shown a convergent tendency for aversion to AI recommendation. It is imperative to find ways to promote AI usage and reduce consumers' AI aversion. This study fills this void by exploring the effect of AI (vs. human) recommenders on consumers' preferences for search versus experience products in the context of e‐commerce. Two studies provide convergent evidence that consumers show less avoidance of algorithms when recommending search products compared to experience products. A behavioral experiment (Study 1, N = 112) validates that consumers are less likely to purchase experience products recommended by AI, while there are no significant differences between AI versus human recommenders when recommending search products. Using event‐related potential (ERP), a further consumer neuroscience study (Study 2, N = 26) shows that consumers have a higher level of cognitive conflict (i.e., a larger magnitude of N2) when AI (vs. human) recommends experience products, while the effect disappears for search products.

ID-129,article,UNCOVERING PATENT PROSECUTION: AN OBVIOUS(NESS) NEGOTIATION.,"Because a patent is a license for a monopoly affkcting the public good, the process of patent prosecution deserves close scrutiny. Yet, significant aspects of this process remain unexplored. In particular. two central thresholds for patent eligibility, ""novelty"" and ""non-"" obviousness, regarded as the bedrock of patent law worldwide, have rarely been examined on an empirical basis. Investigating how these requirements are invoked during the patent prosecution process is critical to understanding how the application of patent law's central tenets affects the quantity and quality of the resulting patents and. ultimately, the public interest. In this empirical study, we examine a representative sample of utility patent applications filed with the Israeli Patent Office (ILPO) between 2012 and 2019 and quantity the occurrence of various grounds the examiner asserted for rejecting the applicants' claims. We jurther investigate the patent oJ.fice's reliance on ""non-novelty"" and ""obviousness"" as grounds for restricting or rejecting patent claims, and we examine the progression of patent applications subject to such determinations. Our results are thought provoking in two, interrelated respects: First, wefound that obviousness-a mixed question of law and.fact-was by far the most common basis for office action rejections, a result we observed consistently when controlling.fbr variables such as the.field of invention, the characteristics of the applicant, and the final disposition of the application. Second, wejbund that while office action rejections often lead to the narrowing or abandonment of claims in ensuing exchanges between the applicant and the examiner, at the end Of this process, most applicants overcome the rejections and a patent, even if narrowed, is granted. These findings reveal that the interplay between the applicant and the patent office is akin to a negotiation-and that this negotiation generally culminates in at least some measure of success for the applicant. These observations have important implications for patent policy and practice. The predominance of obviousness as a ground for Of.lice action rejections, and the ensuing negotiations between the examiner and the applicant, underscore that patent prosecution involves significant legal analysis in addition to technological expertise. The.frequency with which disputes over obviousness arise in the course of patent prosecution suggests that clarification of the standard is imperative. This requires further development of the doctrine by courts: yet in practice, the patent office's decisions are rarely subject to judicial review. Therefore, there is a pressing need to encourage greater judicial oversight of patent office decisions. The need for doctrinal clarity is particularly acute in view of efforts to integrate advanced computational technologies (such as artificial intelligence systems) into the patent prosecution process. It is questionable whether these technologies may be used to support examiners' legal analysis, especially considering its uncertainty. Moreover, our study suggests that patent examiners-whose role is to grant or reject patent applications in an objective manner that reflects interpretations of the law made by courts-may. And it difficult to exercise their junction consistently due to the individualized give-and-take that occurs in case-by-case negotiations with applicants. Accordingly, policymakers may wish to consider whether to impose limits on such negotiations to ensure that decisions by the patent office are free from the influence Of applicant ""bargaining and produce predictable results that maximize the public good.

ID-130,article,,"The boom in artificial intelligence and automated technology in the journalistic profession has given rise to what are called synthetic media (Crusafon, 2022), media outlets that produce and publish texts, audio, videos, and other news content through processes executed solely by algorithms, without any intervention from journalists. This research has several objectives: to identify the first synthetic media outlets already operating, to describe how these newsrooms without journalists work, to better understand the type of content they produce, and to find out whether these are isolated and ephemeral operations or if, on the contrary, they mark the beginning of a trend toward journalism without the direct intervention of journalists. To this end, we have used an exploratory methodology, enabling us to identify four synthetic media outlets, which have been taken as an analysis sample: JX Press Corp (Japan); Reuters News Tracer (United Kingdom), News Republic (France), and Videre AI (Spain). An analysis of the news content on each project’s web pages was combined with in-depth semistructured interviews with the heads of technology and communication of the three European ventures. The Japanese initiative has no human staff, so its chatbot was the only way to obtain information. The purpose was to learn about the initiatives’ news production process, their impact on the journalistic profession, and their viability. This analysis helps demonstrate that the journalistic world’s reliance on artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly evident and that communication agencies are the first companies to invest in developing and distributing synthetic content to benchmark media. These initiatives, although still limited, are the most recent step in the process of gradually integrating artificial intelligence into news production.

ID-131,article,What factors contribute to the acceptance of artificial intelligence? A systematic review.,"• Reviewed 60 studies on user acceptance of artificial intelligence. • This is the first paper to provide a comprehensive overview of the psychosocial models and factors influencing user acceptance of AI. • In some cultural scenarios, it appears that the need for human contact cannot be replicated or replaced by AI. • Perceived usefulness, performance expectancy, attitudes, trust, and effort expectancy significantly and positively predicted intention, willingness, and use behaviour of AI across multiple industries. • Future studies should examine role of bias (e.g., job security, pre-existing knowledge) in users' intentions to use AI. Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are predicted to infiltrate most industries within the next decade, creating a personal, industrial, and social shift towards the new technology. As a result, there has been a surge of interest and research towards user acceptance of AI technology in recent years. However, the existing research appears dispersed and lacks systematic synthesis, limiting our understanding of user acceptance of AI technologies. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analysis guidelines using five databases: EBSCO host, Embase, Inspec (Engineering Village host), Scopus, and Web of Science. Papers were required to focus on both user acceptance and AI technology. Acceptance was defined as the behavioural intention or willingness to use, buy, or try a good or service. A total of 7912 articles were identified in the database search. Sixty articles were included in the review. Most studies (n = 31) did not define AI in their papers, and 38 studies did not define AI for their participants. The extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was the most frequently used theory to assess user acceptance of AI technologies. Perceived usefulness, performance expectancy, attitudes, trust, and effort expectancy significantly and positively predicted behavioural intention, willingness, and use behaviour of AI across multiple industries. However, in some cultural scenarios, it appears that the need for human contact cannot be replicated or replaced by AI, no matter the perceived usefulness or perceived ease of use. Given that most of the methodological approaches present in the literature have relied on self-reported data, further research using naturalistic methods is needed to validate the theoretical model/s that best predict the adoption of AI technologies.

ID-132,article,When AI moderates online content: effects of human collaboration and interactive transparency on user trust.,"Given the scale of user-generated content online, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to flag problematic posts is inevitable, but users do not trust such automated moderation of content. We explore if (a) involving human moderators in the curation process and (b) affording ""interactive transparency,"" wherein users participate in curation, can promote appropriate reliance on AI. We test this through a 3 (Source: AI, Human, Both) × 3 (Transparency: No Transparency, Transparency-Only, Interactive Transparency) × 2 (Classification Decision: Flagged, Not Flagged) between-subjects online experiment (N = 676) involving classification of hate speech and suicidal ideation. We discovered that users trust AI for the moderation of content just as much as humans, but it depends on the heuristic that is triggered when they are told AI is the source of moderation. We also found that allowing users to provide feedback to the algorithm enhances trust by increasing user agency.

ID-134,article,,"The implementation of artificial intelligence techniques and tools in the media will systematically and continuously alter their work and that of their professionals during the coming decades. To this end, this article carries out a systematic review of the research conducted on the implementation of AI in the media over the last two decades, particularly empirical research, to identify the main social and epistemological challenges posed by its adoption. For the media, increased dependence on technological platforms and the defense of their editorial independence will be the main challenges. Journalists, in turn, are torn between the perceived threat to their jobs and the loss of their symbolic capital as intermediaries between reality and audiences, and a liberation from routine tasks that subsequently allows them to produce higher quality content. Meanwhile, audiences do not seem to perceive a great difference in the quality and credibility of automated texts, although the ease with which texts are read still favors human authorship. In short, beyond technocentric or deterministic approaches, the use of AI in a specifically human field such as journalism requires a social approach in which the appropriation of innovations by audiences and the impact it has on them is one of the keys to its development. Therefore, the study of AI in the media should focus on analyzing how it can affect individuals and journalists, how it can be used for the proper purposes of the profession and social good, and how to close the gaps that its use can cause.

However, most algorithm aversion studies rely on American samples, potentially limiting the generalisability of the findings. Given the increasing adoption of algorithms globally, we explore if the impact of two crucial factors driving algorithm aversion, uniqueness neglect and familiarity, differ between culturally different countries. Drawing on the individualism-collectivism cultural dimension, we conducted two online studies comparing algorithm aversion between people in India and the United States in medical and financial services scenarios. While our results suggest that there is no difference in the degree of algorithm aversion between Indians and Americans at an aggregate level, we find important cross-cultural differences: Uniqueness neglect strengthens algorithm aversion for Americans more than Indians, while familiarity weakens algorithm aversion more for Indians than Ameri-cans.

Drawing on the regulatory focus theory, through four studies, we discovered that (1) customers' mindset was relatively more prevention-focused when using robo-advisors and relatively more promotion-focused when using human advisors; (2) perceived flexibility mediated this effect; and (3) the algorithm aversion effects existed in automated wealth management, but vanished among prevention-focused customers because of the fit effects.

Low-skill workers receive worse information than the algorithm and hence should always follow the algorithm's signal, while high-skill workers receive better information than the algorithm and should sometimes override it. However, due to reputational concerns, low-skill workers inefficiently override the algorithm to increase the likelihood they are perceived as high-skill.

A systematic literature review on algorithm aversion,"With the continuing application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in decision-making, algorithmic decision-making is becoming more efficient, often even outperforming humans. Despite this superior performance, people often consciously or unconsciously display reluctance to rely on algorithms, a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion. Viewed as a behavioral anomaly, algorithm aversion has recently attracted much scholarly attention. With a view to synthesize the findings of existing literature, we systematically review 80 empirical studies identified through searching in seven academic databases and using the snowballing technique. We inductively categorize the influencing factors of algorithm aversion under four main themes: algorithm, individual, task, and high-level. Our analysis reveals that although algorithm and individual factors have been investigated extensively, very little attention has been given to exploring the task and high-level factors. We contribute to algorithm aversion literature by proposing a comprehensive framework, highlighting open issues in existing studies, and outlining several research avenues that could be handled in future research.

With the potential of new data sources and new techniques for data analysis, human forecasters are increasingly interacting with algorithms. Although algorithms can show better forecasting performance than humans, forecasters do not always accept these algorithms and instead show aversion to them. Algorithm aversion has become a widely known phenomenon. Drawing on the seminal study of Dietvorst et al. (J Exp Psychol Gen 144(1):114-126, 2015), we extend the evidence on algorithm aversion by introducing three environmental variables from the management accounting literature. We argue that time pressure, ""do your best"" goals, and forecasters' data input decision rights on the algorithms input mitigate algorithm aversion. To test our hypotheses, we conducted an experimental study with 1,840 participants overall. We found support for our hypothesis that time pressure mitigates algorithm aversion.

ID-141,article,When Self-Humanization Leads to Algorithm Aversion: What Users Want from Decision Support Systems on Prosocial Microlending Platforms,"Decision support systems are increasingly being adopted by various digital platforms. However, prior research has shown that certain contexts can induce algorithm aversion, leading people to reject their decision support. This paper investigates how and why the context in which users are making decisions (for-profit versus prosocial microlending decisions) affects their degree of algorithm aversion and ultimately their preference for more human-like (versus computer-like) decision support systems. The study proposes that contexts vary in their affordances for self-humanization. Specifically, people perceive prosocial decisions as more relevant to self-humanization than for-profit contexts, and, in consequence, they ascribe more importance to empathy and autonomy while making decisions in prosocial contexts. This increased importance of empathy and autonomy leads to a higher degree of algorithm aversion. At the same time, it also leads to a stronger preference for human-like decision support, which could therefore serve as a remedy for an algorithm aversion induced by the need for self-humanization. The results from an online experiment support the theorizing. The paper discusses both theoretical and design implications, especially for the potential of anthropomorphized conversational agents on platforms for prosocial decision-making.",,1,1,1,finance,,,"compared prosocial vs. for-profit contexts.

Therefore, we conduct an experiment to examine how algorithm aversion manifests in auditor judgments. Consistent with theory, we find that auditors receiving contradictory evidence from their firm's AI system (instead of a human specialist) propose smaller adjustments to management's complex estimates, particularly when management develops their estimates using relatively objective (vs. subjective) inputs.

ID-143,article,What drives managers towards algorithm aversion and how to overcome it? Mitigating the impact of innovation resistance through technology readiness,"Artificial intelligence has been increasingly used in many managerial decision-making contexts for its superior performance. However, many managers are still averse to using AI algorithms in decision-making. The benefits of algorithms cannot be realized optimally if managers are reluctant to use them. Although there are many studies investigating the factors that make an individual averse towards algorithms, studies examining such factors in the managerial decision-making context are scarce. This study, drawing on the innovation resistance theory and the technology readiness concept, proposes a structural model depicting relationships between managers' perceived barriers and algorithm aversion. The model also incorporates the role of managers' technology read-iness in influencing these relationships. To test the model, data were collected from 179 managers of 31 banks/ financial institutions in Bangladesh through an online survey and were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results indicate that barriers related to value, tradition, and image are significantly associated with algorithm aversion, whereas barriers related to usage and risk have a non-significant impact.

ID-144,article,Overcome Medical Algorithm Aversion: Conditional Joint Effect of Direct and Indirect Information,"The just-ended COVID-19 pandemic and the looming global aging remind us that we need to be prepared for the shortage of doctors, which might become an urgent medical crisis in the future. Medical AI could relieve this urgency and sometimes perform better than human doctors; however, people are reluctant to trust medical AI because of algorithm aversion. Although several factors that can minimize algorithm aversion have been identified, they are not effective enough to promote medical AI as people's first choice. Therefore, inspired by the direct and indirect information model of trust and media equation hypothesis, this research explored a new method to minimize aversion to medical AI by highlighting its social attributes. In 3 between-subject studies, a medical AI system's direct information (i.e., transparency and quantitation of the decision-making process (DMP)) and indirect information (i.e., social proof) were manipulated. Study 1 (N = 193) and 2 (N = 429) showed that transparency of DMP and social proof increased trust in AI, but did not affect trust in human doctors. Social proof jointly affected trust in AI with non-quantitative DMP but not quantitative DMP. Study 3 (N = 184) further revealed the joint effect of the transparent non-quantitative DMP and near-perfect social proof, which could minimize algorithm aversion. These results extended the direct-indirect information model in interpersonal trust, revealed conditional media equation in human-AI trust, and offered practical implications for medical AI interface design.",https://www-tandfonline-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/epdf/10.1080/10447318.2024.2344146?needAccess=true,1,1,1,medical,,,,Yansong Zhao and Chengli Xiao,doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2024.2344146,1044-7318,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION,,,,,WOS:001216924300001,,,https://www-tandfonline-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/epdf/10.1080/10447318.2024.2344146?needAccess=true,2024,,

We identify contextual experience and herding as two important factors that explain ridesharing drivers' aversion to an algorithm that is designed to help drivers make better location choices. Specifically, we find that drivers are less likely to follow the algorithm when the algorithmic recommendation does not align with their past experience at a given location-time unit and when their peers' actions contradict the algorithmic recommendations. We discuss the managerial implications of these findings.",https://pubsonline-informs-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/epdf/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02475,1,1,1,,,,"no comparison to human recommender, but we should keep because it's explicitly about algorithm aversion.",Meng Liu and Xiaocheng Tang and Siyuan Xia and Shuo Zhang and Yuting Zhu and Qianying Meng,doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02475,0025-1909,,MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,,,,,WOS:001082744200001,,,https://pubsonline-informs-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/epdf/10.1287/mnsc.2022.02475,2023,,
ID-146,article,Algorithm Aversion as an Obstacle in the Establishment of Robo Advisors,"Within the framework of a laboratory experiment, we examine to what extent algorithm aversion acts as an obstacle in the establishment of robo advisors. The subjects had to complete diversification tasks. They could either do this themselves or they could delegate them to a robo advisor. The robo advisor evaluated all the relevant data and always made the decision which led to the highest expected value for the subjects' payment. Although the high level of efficiency in the robo advisor was clear to see, the subjects only entrusted their decisions to the robo advisor in around 40% of cases. In this way, they reduced their success and their payment. Many subjects orientated themselves towards the 1/n-heuristic, which also contributed to their suboptimal decisions. As long as the subjects had to make decisions for others, they noticeably made a greater effort and were also more successful than when they made decisions for themselves. However, this did not have an effect on their acceptance of robo advisors. Even when they made decisions on behalf of others, the robo advisor was only consulted in around 40% of cases. This tendency towards algorithm aversion among subjects is an obstacle to the broader establishment of robo advisors.",,3,,,,,,,Ibrahim Filiz and Jan Rene Judek and Marco Lorenz and Markus Spiwoks,doi.org/10.3390/jrfm15080353,1911-8066,8,JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT,,,,,WOS:000845542600001,,15,,2022,,
ID-147,article,"Algorithm aversion, emotions, and investor reaction: Does disclosing the use of AI influence investment decisions?","Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) in accounting systems to reduce uncertainty and improve accuracy. However, algorithm aversion (Dietvorst et al., 2015) indicates that individuals often avoid information provided by automated systems as compared to that provided by humans. This paper is an exploratory step towards documenting an emotional response to AI. We experimentally investigate how disclosing the use of AI rather than human staff for estimating the fair value of an asset influences investment decisions through lower levels of emotional response, particularly in pleasantness and attentiveness. Consistent with algorithm aversion, we find that disclosing the use of AI to estimate the asset's fair value reduces the effect of information valence on nonprofessional investor responses. Specifically, when a company's AI usage is disclosed, investors make smaller additional investments when fair value information is positive and smaller investment withdrawals when fair value information is negative, as compared to when human staff usage is disclosed. Importantly, we also find that emotions mediate the effect of information source (AI versus human staff) and moderate the effect of information valence on investment decisions.",,1,1,1,finance,,,,Tom Downen and Sarah Kim and Lorraine Lee,10.1016/j.accinf.2023.100664,1467-0895,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS,,,,,WOS:001145854000001,,52,,2024,,

ID-149,article,Mitigating Algorithm Aversion in Recruiting: A Study on Explainable AI for Conversational Agents,"The use of conversational agents (CAs) based on artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more common in the field of recruiting. Organizations are now adopting AI-based CAs for applicant (pre-)selection, but negative news coverage, especially the black-box character of AI, has hindered adoption. So far, little is known about the contextual factors influencing users' perception of AI-based CAs in general and the effect of provided explanations by explainable AI (XAI) in particular. While research on algorithm aversion provides some initial explanations, information regarding the effects of different XAI approaches on different types of decisions on the attitudes of (potential) applicants is scarce. Therefore, in this study, we use a quantitative, quota-representative study (n = 490) to assess the acceptance of CAs in recruiting. By applying an experimental within-subject design, we provide a more nuanced perspective on why and when providing explanations increases user acceptance. We also show that contextual factors such as the type of assessed skills are major determinants of this effect, and we conclude that XAI is not a ""one-size-fits-all approach."" Based on the insight that contextual factors of the decision problem are more important than the type of XAI approach itself, we argue that the use and the effects of explainability in recruiting need a more nuanced perspective, focusing on the fit of explanations with the user's characteristics and preferences.",,3,,,,,,,Juergen Fleiss and Elisabeth Back and Stefan Thalmann,,0095-0033,1,DATA BASE FOR ADVANCES IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS,,,,56-87,WOS:001208782300004,,55,,2024,,

ID-151,article,Social trust and algorithmic equity: The societal perspectives of users' intention to interact with algorithm recommendation systems,"The use of algorithm recommendation systems (ARS), which collect and analyze users' personal data to generate personalized and tailored recommended items, has become widespread in the era of mobile internet. While related literature has focused on privacy issues and trust toward ARS or recommended items, societal aspects such as social trust (toward people and organizations responsible for an algorithm) and algorithmic equity have been overlooked. Drawing on the theory of social trust, we investigate the psychological mechanism between social trust and users' intention to interact with ARS (e.g., click recommended items and continuously use). Based on a survey of young mobile internet users in China, we show that, first, social trust is positively associated with perceived benefits and perceived algorithmic equity, which are further linked to intention to click recommended items and intention to continuously use ARS (i.e., continuance intention). Second, social trust is negatively related to perceived risks, in turn reducing intention to click. Further, algorithm aversion weakens the negative association between social trust and perceived risk. Our study contributes to the ARS literature from the societal aspect, by validating the importance of social trust, demonstrating the key role of perceived algorithmic equity, and examining the trait of algorithm aversion as a moderator in the formation of algorithm-related perceptions.

We examine initial trust (cognitive trust and behaviour) as well as its development after performance feedback by conducting an online experiment that asked participants to forecast the expected demand for a product. Advice accuracy was manipulated by +/- 5 % relative to the participant's initial forecasting accuracy determined in a pre-test. Results show that initial behaviour towards algorithmic advice is not influenced by cognitive trust. Furthermore, the decision maker's initial forecasting accuracy indicates a threshold between near-perfect and bad advice.

The reliance on the low performing algorithm was positive even when participants could infer that they outperformed the algorithm.

In response to social media platforms mandating the disclosure of GenAI content, we investigate how followers perceive brands that use GenAI for content creation.

These effects are mediated by followers' perceptions of brand authenticity and can be triggered by GenAI disclosure.

ID-156,article,Consumer responses to human-AI collaboration at organizational frontlines: strategies to escape algorithm aversion in content creation,"Although Artificial Intelligence can offer significant business benefits, many consumers have negative perceptions of AI, leading to negative reactions when companies act ethically and disclose its use. Based on the pervasive example of content creation (e.g., via tools like ChatGPT), this research examines the potential for human-AI collaboration to preserve consumers' message credibility judgments and attitudes towards the company. The study compares two distinct forms of human-AI collaboration, namely AI-supported human authorship and human-controlled AI authorship, with traditional human authorship or full automation. Building on the compensatory control theory and the algorithm aversion concept, the study evaluates whether disclosing a high human input share (without explicit control) or human control over AI (with lower human input share) can mitigate negative consumer reactions. Moreover, this paper investigates the moderating role of consumers' perceived morality of companies' AI use. Results from two experiments in different contexts reveal that human-AI collaboration can alleviate negative consumer responses, but only when the collaboration indicates human control over AI. Furthermore, the effects of content authorship depend on consumers' moral acceptance of a company's AI use. AI authorship forms without human control lead to more negative consumer responses in case of low perceived morality (and no effects in case of high morality), whereas messages from AI with human control were not perceived differently to human authorship, irrespective of the morality level.

ID-158,article,PREJUDICED AGAINST THE MACHINE? IMPLICIT ASSOCIATIONS AND THE TRANSIENCE OF ALGORITHM AVERSION,"Algorithm aversion is an important and persistent issue that prevents harvesting the benefits of advancements in artificial intelligence. The literature thus far has provided explanations that primarily focus on conscious reflective processes. Here, we supplement this view by taking an unconscious perspective that can be highly informative. Building on theories of implicit prejudice, in a preregistered study, we suggest that people develop an implicit bias (i.e., prejudice) against artificial intelligence (AI) systems, as a different and threatening ""species,"" the behavior of which is unknown. Like in other contexts of prejudice, we expected people to be guided by this implicit bias but try to override it. This leads to some willingness to rely on algorithmic advice (appreciation), which is reduced as a function of people's implicit prejudice against the machine. Next, building on the somatic marker hypothesis and the accessibility-diagnosticity perspective, we provide an explanation as to why aversion is ephemeral. As people learn about the performance of an algorithm, they depend less on primal implicit biases when deciding whether to rely on the AI's advice. Two studies (n(1) = 675, n(2) = 317) that use the implicit association test consistently support this view. Two additional studies (n(3) = 255, n(4) = 332) rule out alternative explanations and provide stronger support for our assertions. The findings ultimately suggest that moving the needle between aversion and appreciation depends initially on one's general unconscious bias against AI because there is insufficient information to override it. They further suggest that in later use stages, this shift depends on accessibility to diagnostic information about the AI's performance, which reduces the weight given to unconscious prejudice.",,1,1,1,,,,,Ofir Turel and Shivam Kalhan,10.25300/MISQ/2022/17961,0276-7783,4,MIS QUARTERLY,,,,1369-1394,WOS:001179740000003,,47,,2023,,

This paper develops a formal theory to explain some of these conflicting facts and submit new testable predictions. Drawing from decision analysis, I invoke two key notions: the 'value of information' and the 'value of control'. The value of information matters to users of algorithms like recommender systems and prediction machines, which essentially provide information. I find that ambiguity aversion or a subjective cost of employing an algorithm will tend to decrease the value of algorithmic information, while repeated exposure to an algorithm might not always increase this value. The value of control matters to users who may delegate decision making to an algorithm. I model how, under partial delegation, imperfect understanding of what the algorithm actually does (so the algorithm is in fact a black box) can cause algorithm aversion.

In healthcare, algorithmic decision-making is said to outperform clinicians in their treatment choices and recommendations. Yet, relying on an algorithm outcome for clinical decisions comes with uncertainties resulting from the opacity, inconsistency and inaccuracy usurping the epistemic authority of clinicians and ultimately creating aversion. This study explores latent factors that constitute aversion to using algorithm-augmented mobile clinical decision support (mCDS) applications (apps) by clinicians at the point of care. Given that aversion encompasses a tendency to avoid potential risks, we modelled clinicians' preferences using choice-based conjoint analysis with Hierarchical Bayes (HB) estimation methods to examine 362 clinicians' aversion algorithm-augmented mCDS apps. In order of magnitude, the findings indicate that clinicians using mCDS apps are averse to algorithms undermining their epistemic authority with persistently inconsistent results at the point of care. In essence, clinicians will at the point-of-care resist algorithms that restrict them from modifying the result in line with their professional responsibilities.

ID-161,article,Let me decide: Increasing user autonomy increases recommendation acceptance,"The use of algorithm assistance for decision making is vastly increasing in recent years, largely in online settings wherein users receive advice from recommendation systems. Despite the prevalence of such augmented decision making, users sometimes demonstrate aversion toward algorithms and even reject the recommendations of highly accurate systems. Research in behavioral decision making on the one hand, and in information systems on the other, has yet to fully comprehend these phenomena. We build on insight from these two research streams, as well as from self-determination theory, in identifying the psychological need for autonomy as a driver of decreasing algorithm aversion and increasing recommendation acceptance. We identify two concrete autonomy mechanisms-choice autonomy and control autonomy-which may increase the willingness of users to accept algorithmic recommendations. In three online experiments, simulating the process of selecting a vacation package, we consistently find that showing users multiple recommendations instead of a single recommendation, thereby increasing their choice autonomy, significantly increases recommendation acceptance, both when the system is perfectly accurate (Study 1) and when it is not (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore, we find in Study 3 that allowing users control over whether they receive single or multiple recommendations, thereby increasing their control autonomy, has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between choice autonomy and recommendation acceptance, suggesting a complementarity between the two autonomy mechanisms. In so doing, we provide theoretical grounding and empirical evidence for the positive consequences of increasing user autonomy on the effectiveness of recommendation systems.",,3,,,,,,"varied the user's level of autonomy, but did not compare to human agent",Lior Fink and Leorre Newman and Uriel Haran,doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2024.108244,0747-5632,,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,,,,,WOS:001235327700001,,156,,2024,,
ID-162,article,Mixed-effects regression weights for advice taking and related phenomena of information sampling and utilization,"Advice taking and related research is dominated by deterministic weighting indices, specifically ratio-of-differences-based formulas for investigating informational influence. Their arithmetic is intuitively simple, but they pose several measurement problems and restrict research to a particular paradigmatic approach. As a solution, we propose to specify how strongly peoples' judgments are influenced by externally provided evidence by fitting corresponding mixed-effects regression models. Our approach explicitly distinguishes between endogenous components, such as updated beliefs, and exogenous components, such as independent initial judgments and advice. Crucially, mixed-effects regression coefficients of various exogenous sources of information also reflect individual weighting but are based on a conceptually consistent representation of the endogenous judgment process. The formal derivation of the proposed weighting measures is accompanied by a detailed elaboration on their most important technical and statistical subtleties. We use this modeling approach to revisit empirical findings from several paradigms investigating algorithm aversion, sequential collaboration, and advice taking. In summary, we replicate and extend the original finding of algorithm appreciation and initially demonstrate a lack of evidence for both systematic order effects in sequential collaboration as well as differential weighting of multiple pieces of advice. In addition to opening new avenues for innovative research, appropriate modeling of information sampling and utilization has the potential to increase the reproducibility and replicability of behavioral science. Furthermore, the proposed method is relevant beyond advice taking, as mixed-effects regression weights can also inform research on related cognitive phenomena such as multidimensional belief updating, anchoring effects, hindsight bias, or attitude change.",,1,3,1,,,,,Tobias R Rebholz and Marco Biella and Mandy Huetter,doi.org/10.1002/bdm.2369,0894-3257,2,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DECISION MAKING,,,,,WOS:001184124000001,,37,,2024,,

ID-167,article,Managerial advice-taking-Sharing responsibility with (non)human advisors trumps decision accuracy,"Organizations are increasingly implementing algorithmic decision aids to advise managerial decision-making. We study managers' motives behind using advice (human and nonhuman), particularly sharing responsibility versus increasing decision accuracy motives. We conduct an online experiment with experienced managers in a sales forecasting setting and find that managers focus on increasing decision accuracy (sharing responsibility) when they are unable (able) to share responsibility with advisors. Moreover, managers prefer to share responsibility with blamable human advisors over nonhuman advisors unless they perceive algorithms as socially competent. Consequently, the results show that managers are not solely motivated to minimize forecast errors but also to reduce personal responsibility when taking advice. We contribute to the literature by highlighting the opportunistic motives of managers when taking (non)human advice. Our findings also bear important implications for practice.

We assess whether perceived ethicalness of police violence is higher when police follow robot advice to arrest a passer-by, compared to no robot advice to arrest the passer-by. Using neutralization theory, we test how blame-shifting occurs. When police violently arrest an innocent passer-by, the violence is neutralized when the decision was made following the AI-robot.

However, it is an open question to what extent economic consequences affect preferences for public policies governing AI. When does the public demand imposing restrictions on - or even prohibiting - emerging AI technologies? Do average citizens' preferences depend causally on normative and economic concerns or only on one of these causes? If both, how might economic risks and opportunities interact with assessments based on normative factors? And to what extent does the balance between the two kinds of concerns vary by context? I answer these questions using a comparative conjoint survey experiment conducted in Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Chile, and China.

This is particularly true in domains where the decisions are high-stakes, such as law, medicine, and the military. In this Perspective, we describe the particular challenges for AI decision support posed in military coalition operations. These include having to deal with limited, low-quality data, which inevitably compromises AI performance. We suggest that these problems can be mitigated by taking steps that allow rapid trust calibration so that decision makers understand the AI system's limitations and likely failures and can calibrate their trust in its outputs appropriately.

We use an online experiment to study the preference for human or algorithmic decision makers in redistributive decisions. In particular, we consider whether an algorithmic decision maker will be preferred because of its impartiality. Contrary to previous findings, the majority of participants (over 60%) prefer the algorithm as a decision maker over a human-but this is not driven by concerns over biased decisions. However, despite this preference, the decisions made by humans are regarded more favorably. Subjective ratings of the decisions are mainly driven by participants' own material interests and fairness ideals.

In five online studies (N = 1077), participants were asked to make selection decisions in which the selection test was affected by irrelevant attributes. We examined whether in such decisions people are willing to be advised by algorithms, human advisors or prefer to decide without advice. We found that people fail to adjust for irrelevant information by themselves, and those who received advice from an algorithm or human advisor made better decisions. Interestingly, although most participants stated they prefer advice from human advisors, they tend to rely equally on algorithms in actual selection tasks.

Our main result is that the hybrid system generated more accurate forecasts compared to a human-only baseline, which had no machine generated predictions. We found that skilled forecasters who had access to machine-generated forecasts outperformed those who only viewed historical data.

Two types of explanations were tested: full-text global explanations and an accuracy statement. The results showed that both explanations did not have an effect on student trust or motivation compared to no explanations. Interestingly, the grade provided by the system, and especially the difference between the student's self-estimated grade and the system grade, showed a large influence.

ID-176,article,Understanding the Influence Discrepancy Between Human and Artificial Agent in Advice Interactions: The Role of Stereotypical Perception of Agency,"This paper proposes that artificial agents' underperformance in interpersonal influence situations can be explained by stereotypical perceptions of such agents' lack of capacity to act and accomplish goals (i.e., agency), triggered by their non-human identity. In two experiments of text-based conversations (N = 305 and 309), the identity of a human advice giver was manipulated to be either a human or a chatbot. The chatbot identity resulted in less perceived agency of the giver, which then mediated the identity's effects on the advice seeker's (a) perceived advice effectiveness and (b) intention to follow advice after the conversation, as well as (c) adherence to advice and (d) trouble relief after a week. A positive correlation between perceived agency of the artificial agent and the seeker's self-efficacy was identified as part of this mediation.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 HR professionals from 21 companies. The results revealed that HR professionals' beliefs about AI could be categorised along two dimensions: (1) the scope of AI and (2) the definition of instruction. ""Scope of Al"" describes the perceived technical capabilities of AI and determines the use cases that HR professionals imagine. In contrast, the ""definition of instruction"" describes the perceived effort to enable an AI to take on a task and determines how HR professionals perceive barriers to Al.

ID-178,article,Perceived opacity leads to algorithm aversion in the workplace,"With algorithms standing out and influencing every aspect of human society, people's attitudes toward algorithmic invasion have become a vital topic to be discussed. Recently, algorithms as alternatives and enhancements to human decision-making have become ubiquitously applied in the workplace. Despite algorithms offering numerous advantages, such as vast data storage and anti-interference performance, previous research has found that people tend to reject algorithmic agents across different applications. Especially in the realm of human resources, the increasing utilization of algorithms forces us to focus on users' attitudes. Thus, the present study aimed to explore public attitudes toward algorithmic decision-making and probe the underlying mechanism and potential boundary conditions behind the possible difference.To verify our research hypotheses, four experiments (N = 1211) were conducted, which involved various kinds of human resource decisions in the daily workplace, including resume screening, recruitment and hiring, allocation of bonuses, and performance assessment. Experiment 1 used a single-factor, two-level, between-subjects design. 303 participants were randomly assigned to two conditions (agent of decision-making: human versus algorithm) and measured their permissibility, liking, and willingness to utilize the agent. Experiment 1 was designed to be consistent with Experiment 2. The only difference was an additional measurement of perceived transparency to test the mediating role. Experiment 3 aimed to establish a causal chain between the mediator and dependent variables by manipulating the perceived transparency of the algorithm. In Experiment 4, a single-factor three-level between-subjects design ( non-anthropomorphism algorithm versus anthropomorphism algorithm versus human) was utilized to explore the boundary condition of this effect.As anticipated, the present research revealed a pervasive algorithmic aversion across diverse organizational settings. Specifically, we conceptualized algorithm aversion as a tripartite framework encompassing cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions. We found that compared with human managers, participants demonstrated significantly lower permissibility (Experiments: 1, 2, and 4), liking (Experiments: 1, 2, and 4), and willingness to utilize (Experiment 2) algorithmic management. And the robustness of this result was demonstrated by the diversity of our scenarios and samples. Additionally, this research discovered perceived transparency as an interpretation mechanism explaining participants' psychological reactions to different decision-making agents. That is to say, participants were opposed to algorithmic management because they thought its decision processes were more incomprehensible and inaccessible than humans (noted in Experiment 2). Addressing this "" black box"" phenomenon, Experiment 3 showed that providing more information and principles about algorithmic management positively influenced participants' attitudes. Crucially, the result also demonstrated the moderating effect of anthropomorphism. The result showed that participants exhibited greater permissibility and liking for the algorithm with human-like characteristics, such as a human-like name and communication style, over more than a mechanized form of the algorithm. This observation underlined the potential of anthropomorphism to ameliorate resistance to algorithmic management.These results bridge the gap between algorithmic aversion and decision transparency from the social-psychological perspective. Firstly, the present research establishes a three-dimensional (cognitive, affective, and behavioral) dual-perspective (employee and employer) model to elucidate the negative responses toward algorithmic management. Secondly, it reveals that perceived opacity acts as an obstacle to embracing algorithmic decision-making. This finding lays the theoretical foundation of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) which is conceptualized as a ""glass box"". Ultimately, the study highlights the moderating effect of anthropomorphism on algorithmic aversion. This suggests that anthropomorphizing algorithms could be a feasible approach to facilitate the integration of intelligent management systems.",,1,1,1,,,,,Zhao Yijun and Xu Liying and Yu Feng and Jin Wanglong,10.3724/SP.J.1041.2024.00497,0439-755X,4,ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA,,,,497-514,WOS:001208692100010,,56,,2024,,

Aesthetic evaluation of human-made and AI-generated haiku poetry,"With the development of technology, the quality of AI-generated text has improved. This is relevant in the AI art field, where AI generates literature or poetry that is appreciated. This study compared human-made and AI -generated haiku poetry, which is composed with 17 syllables and the world's shortest and clearest rules, to examine aesthetic evaluations of AI art and people's beliefs about it. AI-generated haiku were divided into those with and without human intervention. Two tasks were completed by 385 participants. The first involved eval-uating human-made and AI-generated haiku on 21 items, such as beauty. The second involved determining whether the haiku were human-made or AI-generated. The results showed that the beauty rating of the AI -generated haiku with the human intervention was the highest, and those of the human-made and AI -generated haiku without human intervention were equal. Furthermore, participants could not distinguish be-tween human-made and AI-generated haiku. These results suggest that human-AI collaboration has better creativity in haiku production. Moreover, a negative correlation was found between discrimination performance and beauty rating in AI-generated haiku, suggesting that high-quality AI-generated work is believed to be human -made.

This study analyzes disclosure effects and explores the deployment of an AI application in a preregistered field experiment (n = 2,000) co-designed with a public organization in the context of employer-driven recruitment. The linear regression results show that disclosing the use of the AI application leads to significantly less interest in an offer among job candidates. The explorative analysis of the deployment of the AI application indicates that the person-job fit determined by the leaders can be predicted by the AI application. Based on the literature on algorithm aversion and digital discretion, this study provides a theoretical and empirical disentanglement of the disclosure effect and the deployment effect to inform future evaluations of AI applications in the public sector.

This study conducted four experiments (N = 2221) and tested whether people's trust in SDVs was lower than that in human drivers when they made errors without causing negative events. In Experiments 1 and 2, which manipulated the driving accuracy of the drivers, the participants checked nine different pieces of information that showed accuracy. The results demonstrated that the SDV was less trusted than humans only when there was a slight possibility of making an error. This study did not identify factors explaining lower trust in the SDV. Experiments 3 and 4 consisted of participants watching videos showing that the SDV and human driver made minor errors, such as taking a long time to park. This study showed that the minor errors largely reduced trust, regardless of whether the vehicle was self-driven or driven by humans.

In particular, this study examined whether baseball fans evaluated more positively a robot umpire depending on whether a robot or a human umpire has the final authority to make ball-strike decisions, when the ball-strike decision contradicts with each other. Furthermore, the different types of expertise (baseball vs. image analysis) embedded in robot umpire and fans’ levels of technology adoption were used to examine the relationship between umpire type and evaluations of robot umpire. METHODS This study used 2 (final decision maker: robot vs. human umpire) by 2 (different types of expertise embedded in robot umpire: baseball vs. image analysis) by 2 (different levels of technology adoption: low vs. high) between-subjects design. RESULTS The results indicated that when a robot umpire had the final authority to make ball-strike decisions, baseball fans evaluated more positively the adoption of robot umpire, when image analysis expertise was embedded in the robot umpire rather than baseball expertise. Meanwhile, baseball fans evaluated more positively the adoption of robot umpire when baseball expertise was embedded in a robot umpire rather than image analysis expertise.

Prior research suggests that the inclusion of new data types - such as social media data - in forecasting models can improve forecasting. We explore whether managers' operational decisions differ depending on the data type used by a predictive analytics tool and the consistency of the trend with prior developments. Experimental results show that the extent to which managers use predictions from analytics tools is a joint function of the data type utilized and trend consistency. If a trend predicted by an analytics tool reveals a downward break from prior positive developments (i.e., an unexpected negative trend), managers utilize predictions less if they are mainly based on social media data rather than on traditional accounting data. If a trend predicted by an analytics tool continues a prior positive trend, we do not find such a difference. In supplemental analyses, we explore managers' comfort level and related attitude concerning the data types and find that only in the trend-breaking condition mediation effects are observed.

Individuals' preferences for AI evaluations,"Gender imbalances in the labor market continue to be an economic and social problem that could be reduced by artificial intelligence (AI), which is being promoted as a means for fairer and less biased hiring practices. To examine whether these supposed benefits of AI are perceived as such, we have investigated the preferences of individuals, particularly women, for an AI-based evaluation process in a competitive situation. The results of our experimental study (N = 152) show that individuals generally prefer a human evaluator over an AI evaluator-but only if the human evaluator is female. Whereas we demonstrate that women's beliefs in AI to reduce bias and perceived personal discrimination have a positive direct effect, we find no direct effect of the competitors' gender on women's preference for an AI evaluation. However, we find that the belief in AI moderates the other two relationships, which highlights the crucial role of people's general perception of AI tools in realizing AI's full potential and reduce anticipated biases.

ID-185,article,The ethical use of artificial intelligence in human resource management: a decision-making framework,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly inputting into various human resource management (HRM) functions, such as sourcing job applicants and selecting staff, allocating work, and offering personalized career coaching. While the use of AI for such tasks can offer many benefits, evidence suggests that without careful and deliberate implementation its use also has the potential to generate significant harms. This raises several ethical concerns regarding the appropriateness of AI deployment to domains such as HRM, which directly deal with managing sometimes sensitive aspects of individuals' employment lifecycles. However, research at the intersection of HRM and technology continues to largely center on examining what AI can be used for, rather than focusing on the salient factors relevant to its ethical use and examining how to effectively engage human workers in its use. Conversely, the ethical AI literature offers excellent guiding principles for AI implementation broadly, but there remains much scope to explore how these principles can be enacted in specific contexts-of-use. By drawing on ethical AI and task-technology fit literature, this paper constructs a decision-making framework to support the ethical deployment of AI for HRM and guide determinations of the optimal mix of human and machine involvement for different HRM tasks.

ID-186,article,Cognitive Challenges in Human-Artificial Intelligence Collaboration: Investigating the Path Toward Productive Delegation,"We study how humans make decisions when they collaborate with an artificial intelligence (AI) in a setting where humans and the AI perform classification tasks. Our experimental results suggest that humans and AI who work together can outperform the AI that outperforms humans when it works on its own. However, the combined performance improves only when the AI delegates work to humans but not when humans delegate work to the AI. The AI's delegation performance improved even when it delegated to low-performing subjects; by contrast, humans did not delegate well and did not benefit from delegation to the AI. This bad delegation performance cannot be explained with some kind of algorithm aversion. On the contrary, subjects acted rationally in an internally consistent manner by trying to follow a proven delegation strategy and appeared to appreciate the AI support. However, human performance suffered as a result of a lack of metaknowledge-that is, humans were not able to assess their own capabilities correctly, which in turn led to poor delegation decisions.

ID-187,article,Managerial overreliance on AI-augmented decision-making processes: How the use of AI-based advisory systems shapes choice behavior in R&D investment decisions,"AI-augmented decision-making processes promise to transform strategic decisions around innovation management. However, despite a growing body of research on algorithmic management, very little is known about the behavioral effects of the AI-augmented decision-making process. This article utilizes a psychological perspective to research the interaction of artificial intelligence and human judgment, suggesting that AI-based advice affects human decision-making behavior and skews perceptions of decision outcomes. We present a vignette-based decision experiment involving 150 senior executives to examine the perception of AI-augmented decisionmaking at the individual level. In contrast to earlier research on algorithm aversion, we find that employing AIbased advisory systems positively affects choice behavior and amplifies decision quality perception. We further show how this overreliance on an AI-augmented decision-making process can be explained through both a higher degree of trust in the advisor and the attribution of a more structured process. This paper contributes to the emerging discussion as to the role of AI in management and the novel phenomenon of algorithm appreciation by investigating the interplay of human and artificial intelligence in strategic decision-making to show that AI-based advice is perceived as more trustworthy than human advice in an R&D investment context.",,1,1,1,innovation management,,,,Christoph Keding and Philip Meissner,doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120970,0040-1625,,TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE,,,,,WOS:000681245200011,,171,,2021,,
ID-188,article,Navigating autonomy and control in human-AI delegation: User responses to technology- versus user-invoked task allocation,"Users can increasingly delegate to information systems (IS) - that is transferring rights and responsibilities regarding certain tasks - even to the degree that IS can act autonomously (i.e., without the intervention or supervision of users). What is more, IS increasingly offer to assume the rights and responsibilities for a task not only in response to user prompts (i.e., user-invoked delegation) but also without user prompts (i.e., IS-invoked delegation). Yet, little is known about whether, how, and why users agree to delegation when they are asked by the IS in contrast to when they self-initiate the delegation. Drawing on self-affirmation theory, we investigate user acceptance of IS- versus user-invoked delegation in two complementary online experiments in software development. Our core findings reveal that IS-invoked (vs. user-invoked) delegation increases users' perceived self-threat and thus decreases their willingness to accept delegation. This threatening effect is larger the less (vs. more) the user perceives control after the potential delegation. Taken together, we uncover defensive user responses to IS-invoked delegation. Furthermore, we shed light on the underlying and moderating mechanisms representing the reasons and contextual features that explain and mitigate these defensive measures. These findings have significant implications for IS designers seeking to improve user-IS collaboration and outcomes by employing IS-invoked delegation.",,3,,,,,,comparison groups both involve the use of AI.

Yet, these publications are either descriptions of anecdotal experiences or outdated surveys. Therefore, in several Western countries, we conducted two surveys (total N = 323) and two focus groups to investigate (1) how decision makers in psychological assessment and human resource practice combine information, (2) why they do (not) use mechanical combination, and (3) what may be needed to increase its use in practice. Many participants reported mostly using holistic combination, usually in teams. The most common reasons for not using mechanical combination were that algorithms are unavailable in practice and that stakeholders do not accept their use. Furthermore, decision makers do not quantify information, do not believe in research findings on evidence-based decision making, and think that combining holistic and mechanical combination results in the best decisions. The most important reason why mechanical combination is used was to increase predictive validity. To stimulate the use of mechanical combination in practice, decision makers indicated that they should receive more training on evidence-based decision making and that decision aids supporting the use of mechanical combination should be developed.",,3,,,,,,,Marvin Neumann and A Susan M Niessen and Petra P M Hurks and Rob R Meijer,doi.org/10.1111/ijsa.12416,0965-075X,2,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SELECTION AND ASSESSMENT,,,,267-285,WOS:000921638100001,,31,,2023,,
ID-190,article,Ghosting the Machine: Judicial Resistance to a Recidivism Risk Assessment Instrument [arXiv],"Recidivism risk assessment instruments are presented as an 'evidence-based' strategy for criminal justice reform - a way of increasing consistency in sentencing, replacing cash bail, and reducing mass incarceration. In practice, however, AI-centric reforms can simply add another layer to the sluggish, labyrinthine machinery of bureaucratic systems and are met with internal resistance. Through a community-informed interview-based study of 23 criminal judges and other criminal legal bureaucrats in Pennsylvania, I find that judges overwhelmingly ignore a recently-implemented sentence risk assessment instrument, which they disparage as ""useless,"" ""worthless,"" ""boring,"" ""a waste of time,"" ""a non-thing,"" and simply ""not helpful."" I argue that this algorithm aversion cannot be accounted for by individuals' distrust of the tools or automation anxieties, per the explanations given by existing scholarship. Rather, the instrument's non-use is the result of an interplay between three organizational factors: county-level norms about pre-sentence investigation reports; alterations made to the instrument by the Pennsylvania Sentencing Commission in response to years of public and internal resistance; and problems with how information is disseminated to judges. These findings shed new light on the important role of organizational influences on professional resistance to algorithms, which helps explain why algorithm-centric reforms can fail to have their desired effect. This study also contributes to an empirically-informed argument against the use of risk assessment instruments: they are resource-intensive and have not demonstrated positive on-the-ground impacts.",,3,,,,,,,D Pruss,,,,arXiv,,,,,INSPEC:23491266,,,,2023,,
ID-191,article,Algorithmic augmentation of democracy: considering whether technology can enhance the concepts of democracy and the rule of law through four hypotheticals,"The potential use, relevance, and application of AI and other technologies in the democratic process may be obvious to some. However, technological innovation and, even, its consideration may face an intuitive push-back in the form of algorithm aversion (Dietvorst et al. J Exp Psychol 144(1):114-126, 2015). In this paper, I confront this intuition and suggest that a more 'extreme' form of technological change in the democratic process does not necessarily result in a worse outcome in terms of the fundamental concepts of democracy and the Rule of Law. To provoke further consideration and illustrate that initial intuitions regarding democratic innovation may not always be accurate, I pose and explore four ways that AI and other forms of technology could be used to augment the representative democratic process. The augmentations range from voting online to the wholesale replacement of the legislature's human representatives with algorithms. After first noting the intuition that less invasive forms of augmented democracy may be less objectionable than more extreme forms, I go on to critically assess whether the augmentation of existing systems satisfies or enhances ideas associated with democracy and the Rule of Law (provided by Dahl and Fuller). By imagining a (not too far-fetched) future in a (not too far-removed) democratic society, my conclusion is that, when it comes to democracy and the Rule of Law, intuitions regarding technology may lead us astray.",,3,,,,,,,Paul Burgess,10.1007/s00146-021-01170-8,0951-5666,1,AI & SOCIETY,,,,97-112,WOS:000627654200001,,37,,2022,,
ID-192,article,Is Your Machine Better Than You? You May Never Know,"Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly demonstrating their capacity to make better predictions than human experts. Yet recent studies suggest that professionals sometimes doubt the quality of these systems and overrule machine-based prescriptions. This paper explores the extent to which a decision maker (DM) supervising a machine to make high-stakes decisions can properly assess whether the machine produces better recommendations. To that end, we study a setup in which a machine performs repeated decision tasks (e.g., whether to perform a biopsy) under the DM's supervision. Because stakes are high, the DM primarily focuses on making the best choice for the task at hand. Nonetheless, as the DM observes the correctness of the machine's prescriptions across tasks, the DM updates the DM's belief about the machine. However, the DM is subject to a so-called verification bias such that the DM verifies the machine's correctness and updates the DM's belief accordingly only if the DM ultimately decides to act on the task. In this setup, we characterize the evolution of the DM's belief and overruling decisions over time. We identify situations under which the DM hesitates forever whether the machine is better; that is, the DM never fully ignores but regularly overrules it. Moreover, the DM sometimes wrongly believes with positive probability that the machine is better. We fully characterize the conditions under which these learning failures occur and explore how mistrusting the machine affects them. These findings provide a novel explanation for human-machine complementarity and suggest guidelines on the decision to fully adopt or reject a machine.",https://pubsonline-informs-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4791,4,,,,,,develops a model,Francis de Vericourt and Huseyin Gurkan,doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4791,0025-1909,,MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,,,,,WOS:000998026200001,,,https://pubsonline-informs-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4791,2023,,

We ask this question in a healthcare context where patients must be prioritized according to their need and where advances in autonomous artificial intelligence-based technology offer a compelling alternative to decisions by humans. Qualitative (Study 1a; N = 50) and quantitative (Study 1b; N = 800) analysis identified agency, emotional experience, bias-free, and error-free as four main qualities describing people's perceptions of autonomous computer programs (ACPs) and human staff members (HSMs). Yet, the qualities were not perceived to be possessed equally by HSMs and ACPs. HSMs were endorsed with human qualities of agency and emotional experience, whereas ACPs were perceived as more capable than HSMs of bias- and error-free decision-making. Consequently, better than average (Study 2; N = 371), or relatively better (Studies 3, N = 181; & 4, N = 378), ACP performance, especially on qualities characteristic of ACPs, was sufficient to reverse preferences to favor ACPs over HSMs as the decision makers for how limited healthcare resources should be prioritized.

ID-194,article,"Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: Algorithmic Assessments, Transparency, and Self-Fulfilling Prophecies","Predictive algorithmic scores can significantly impact the lives of assessed individuals by shaping decisions of organizations and institutions that affect them, for example, influencing the hiring prospects of job applicants or the release of defendants on bail. To better protect people and provide them the opportunity to appeal their algorithmic assessments, data privacy advocates and regulators increasingly push for disclosing the scores and their use in decision-making processes to scored individuals. Although inherently important, the response of scored individuals to such algorithmic transparency is understudied and therefore demands further research. Inspired by psychological and economic theories of information processing, we aim to fill this gap. We conducted a comprehensive experimental study with five treatment conditions to explore how and why disclosing the use of algorithmic scoring processes to (involuntarily) scored individuals affects their behaviors. Our results provide strong evidence that the disclosure of fundamentally erroneous algorithmic scores evokes selffulfilling prophecies that endogenously steer the behavior of scored individuals toward their assessment, enabling algorithms to help produce the world they predict. Occurring selffulfilling prophecies are consistent with an anchoring effect and the exploitation of available moral wiggle room. Because scored individuals interpret others' motives for overriding human expert and algorithmic scores differently, self-fulfilling prophecies occur in part only when disclosing algorithmic scores.

ID-195,article,"""My colleague is a robot"" - exploring frontline employees' willingness to work with collaborative service robots","Purpose As service robots increasingly interact with customers at the service encounter, they will inevitably become an integral part of employee's work environment. This research investigates frontline employee's perceptions of collaborative service robots (CSR) and introduces a new framework, willingness to collaborate (WTC), to better understand employee-robot interactions in the workplace. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on appraisal theory, this study employed an exploratory research approach to investigate frontline employees' cognitive appraisal of service robots and their WTC with their nonhuman counterparts in service contexts. Data collection consisted of 36 qualitative problem-centered interviews. Following an iterative thematic analysis, the authors introduce a research framework of frontline employees' WTC with service robots. Findings First, this study demonstrates that the interaction between frontline employees and service robots is a multistage appraisal process based on adoption-related perceptions. Second, it identifies important attributes across three categories (employee, robot and job attributes) that provide a foundation to understand the appraisal of CSRs. Third, it presents four employee personas (supporter, embracer, resister and saboteur) that provide a differentiated perspective of how service employee-robot collaboration may differ. Practical implications The article identifies important factors that enable and restrict frontline service employees' (FSEs') WTC with robots. Originality/value This is the first paper that investigates the appraisal of CSRs from the perspective of frontline employees.

ID-196,article,"Decline, adopt or compromise? A dual hurdle model for advice utilization","Research on advice utilization often operationalizes the construct via Judge Advisor Systems (JAS), where a judge's belief is elicited, they are provided advice, and given an opportunity to revise their belief. Belief change, or weight of advice (WOA), is measured as the shift in the judge's belief proportional to the difference between their original belief and the advice. Several JAS studies have found WOA typically takes on a trimodal distribution, with inflation at the boundary values of 0 (indicating a judge declined advice) and 1 (adoption of advice). A dual hurdle beta model is proposed to account for these inflations. In addition to being an innovative computational model to address this methodological challenge, it also serves as a descriptive theoretical model which posits that the decision process happens in two stages: an initial discrete ""choosing ""stage, where the judge opts to either decline, adopt, or compromise with advice; and a subsequent continuous ""averaging ""stage, which occurs only if the judge opts to compromise. The approach was assessed via reanalysis of three recent JAS studies reflective of popular topics in the literature, such as algorithmic advice utilization, egocentric discounting effects, and judgmental forecasting. In each case new results were uncovered about how different correlates of advice utilization influence the decision process at either or both of the discrete and continuous stages, often in quite different ways, providing support for the descriptive theoretical model. A Bayesian graphical analysis framework is provided that can be applied to future research on advice utilization. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ID-197,article,The AI-augmented crowd: How human crowdvoters adopt AI (or not),"To date, innovation management research on idea evaluation has focused on human experts and crowd evaluators. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), idea evaluation and selection processes need to keep up. As a result, the potential role of AI-enabled systems in idea evaluation has become an important topic in innovation management research and practice. While AI can help overcome human capacity constraints and biases, prior research has identified also aversive behaviors of humans toward AI. However, research has also shown lay people's appreciation of AI. This study focuses on human crowdvoters' AI adoption behavior. More precisely, we focus on gig workers, who despite often lacking expert knowledge are frequently engaged in crowdvoting. To investigate crowdvoters' AI adoption behavior, we conducted a behavioral experimental study (n = 629) with incentive-compatible rewards in a human-AI augmentation scenario. The participants had to predict the success or failure of crowd-generated ideas. In multiple rounds, participants could opt to delegate their decisions to an AI-enabled system or to make their own evaluations. Our findings contribute to the innovation management literature on open innovation, more specifically crowdvoting, by observing how human crowdvoters engage with AI. In addition to showing that the lay status of gig workers does not lead to an appreciation of AI, we identify factors that foster AI adoption in this specific innovation context. We hereby find mixed support for influencing factors previously identified in other contexts, including financial incentives, social incentives, and the provision of information about AI-enabled system's functionality.

Empirical Comparisons of Source Credibility Attributions Between Humans, Humanoid Robots, and Non-human-like Devices","Source credibility is known as an important prerequisite to ensure effective communication (Pornpitakpan, 2004). Nowadays not only humans but also technological devices such as humanoid robots can communicate with people and can likewise be rated credible or not as reported by Fogg and Tseng (1999). While research related to the machine heuristic suggests that machines are rated more credible than humans (Sundar, 2008), an opposite effect in favor of humans' information is supposed to occur when algorithmically produced information is wrong (Dietvorst, Simmons, and Massey, 2015). However, humanoid robots may be attributed more in line with humans because of their anthropomorphically embodied exterior compared to non-human-like technological devices. To examine these differences in credibility attributions a 3 (source-type) x 2 (information's correctness) online experiment was conducted in which 338 participants were asked to either rate a human's, humanoid robot's, or non-human-like device's credibility based on either correct or false communicated information. This between-subjects approach revealed that humans were rated more credible than social robots and smart speakers in terms of trustworthiness and goodwill. Additionally, results show that people's attributions of theory of mind abilities were lower for robots and smart speakers on the one side and higher for humans on the other side and in part influence the attribution of credibility next to people's reliance on technology, attributed anthropomorphism, and morality. Furthermore, no main or moderation effect of the information's correctness was found.

Specifically, prior research repeatedly indicates that decision-makers often refuse to adopt the data-driven, system-generated advice in their working procedures.

We build on the human-centric Smith-Carayon Work System model to synthesise literature from research areas where system acceptance has been explored in more detail. Consequently, we expand the maintenance literature by investigating the human-, task-, and organisational characteristics of PdM implementation. Following the literature review, we distil ten propositions regarding decision-making behaviour in PdM settings. Next, we verify each proposition's relevance through in-depth interviews with experts from both academia and industry. Based on the propositions and interviews, we identify four factors that facilitate PdM adoption: trust between decision-maker and model (maker), control in the decision-making process, availability of sufficient cognitive resources, and proper organisational allocation of decision-making.

Regression analysis was used to analyze the results. Findings Some configurations contribute to greater trust and role clarity with AI as a colleague. There is no configuration in which AI as a colleague produces lower trust than humans. At the same time, the human distrust in AI may be less about human vs AI and more about the division of labor in which human-AI work.

Event-related potentials were recorded including the N2 (reflecting psychological conflict) and P3 (reflecting subjective confidence) components. Behavioral data revealed a classic ""gain-loss asymmetry"" effect in the human-based condition, but not in the computer-based condition, indicating that computerized advice utilization remained prominent across different domains. Moreover, the human-based condition showed a larger option-evoked P3 in the gain than in the loss domain, but no difference was found for the computer-based condition; P3 latency was longer in the human-than in the computer-based condition.

ID-202,article,The future of the labor force: higher cognition and more skills,"Skills can be categorized into two types: social-cognitive and sensory-physical. Sensory-physical skills, governed by explicit rules and transparent rationales, can be effectively executed through meticulous programming, with humans spontaneously trusting machines to perform these skills. In contrast, social-cognitive skills entail open interpretations reliant on personal opinions or intuition and are contextually and problem-dependent. The inherent complexity and subjectivity of social-cognitive skills, underscored by Polanyi's paradox and algorithm aversion, render machines less capable of replicating these skills. Thus, automation exerts differential impacts on these two skill sets. Moreover, the specialization of machines leads to expensive setup costs when switching tasks, whereas humans switch tasks with much less effort. The versatility in skills enables workers to adapt to a wide array of tasks, making them less prone to automation. Our empirical research, utilizing skill score data from O*NET and employment data from Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS), validated the attributes of labor resistant to automation: the higher the scores of cognitive skills in a job, the lower its susceptibility to automation; workers endowed with a diverse array of skills experience an increase in their employment share. Conversely, jobs focusing on sensory-physical skills are more likely to be supplanted by machines. Therefore, workers can adopt two strategies to maintain a competitive edge. First, they can enhance cognitive skills, such as creativity and critical thinking. Second, they can develop diverse skills, encompassing both social-cognitive and sensory-physical skills. Specializing in a specific sensory-physical skill does not offer an advantage. Fostering a workforce proficient in cognitive skills and equipped with multifaceted skills, that is, flexible workers, becomes imperative. Our investigation represents the inaugural effort to empirically affirm the differential impact of automation on sensory-physical versus social-cognitive skills, thereby delineating the characteristics of irreplaceable labor.

Their choice outperformed forecasts made by averaging the model outputs and improved with a larger difference in quality between models and a lower level of noise in the data series. In a second experiment (N= 161), participants were asked to make a forecast and were then offered advice in the form of a model forecast. They could then re-adjust their forecast. Final forecasts were more influenced by models that made better forecasts. As forecasters gained experience, they followed input from high-quality models more readily. Thus, both experiments show that forecasters have ability to use and learn from visual records of past performance to select and adjust model-based forecasts appropriately.

These concerns raise an apparent paradox. In many cases, human decision-makers are just as much of a black-box as the algorithms that are meant to replace them. Yet, the inscrutability of human decision-making seems to raise fewer concerns. We suggest that one of the reasons for this paradox is that people foster an illusion of understanding human better than algorithmic decision-making, when in fact, both are black-boxes. We further propose that this occurs, at least in part, because people project their own intuitive understanding of a decision-making process more onto other humans than onto algorithms, and as a result, believe that they understand human better than algorithmic decision-making, when in fact, this is merely an illusion.",,1,1,1,,,,interesting perspective.

The theory has three phases with propositions related to (1) the foundations of reliance, (2) short-term effects on novice versus expert decision-making, and (3) long-term epistemological effects related to individual deskilling and profession-wide stagnation. In this theory paper, we propose an extension of TTD, that we refer to as TTD2, primarily to increase our theoretical understanding of how, why, and when the short-term and long-term effects on decision-making occur and why advances in technology design have exacerbated some weaknesses and eroded some benefits. Recently, researchers have called for reconsideration of how we design intelligent systems to mitigate the detrimental effects of technology; in TTD2 we provide a theory-based understanding for capturing the complexity underlying the occurrence of the effects.",,3,,,,,,,Steve G Sutton and Vicky Arnold and Matthew Holt,doi.org/10.1016/j.accinf.2023.100626,1467-0895,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS,,,,,WOS:001010971800001,,50,,2023,,

The effect of retailer-provided negative feedback on consumers' product choice and shopping experience,"This research aims at investigating the potential double-edged sword effect of a retailer's negative feedback, which may not only lead consumers to alter their purchase decisions, but also provide a shopping experience that is more effortful and thus be of less utilitarian value. Three experiments were performed involving 678 participants. Overall, results suggest a double-edged sword effect of negative feedback in online and offline retail contexts. When compared to no feedback, neutral feedback, or positive feedback, negative feedback leads consumers to change their initial product choice whatever their choice uncertainty and whatever the feedback source (human advisor or algorithmic advisor). However, it also leads to the perception of more cognitive effort and reduced utilitarian value, resulting in lower purchase and word-of-mouth intentions. The only situation in which negative feedback does not degrade the utilitarian value of the shopping experience is when consumers are highly uncertain about their initial product choice.",,1,1,1,marketing,,,,Aurelie Merle and Anik St-Onge and Sylvain Senecal,doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.03.031,0148-2963,,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH,,,,532-543,WOS:000799247400020,,147,,2022,,

One of the most important domains of racial and economic inequalities is medical outcomes; Black and lowincome people are more likely to die from many diseases. Algorithms can help reduce these inequalities because they are less likely than human doctors to make biased decisions. Unfortunately, people are generally averse to algorithms making important moral decisions-including in medicine-undermining the adoption of AI in healthcare. Here we use the COVID-19 pandemic to examine whether the threat of racial and economic inequality increases the preference for algorithm decision-making. Four studies (N = 2819) conducted in the United States and Singapore show that emphasizing inequality in medical outcomes increases the preference for algorithm decision-making for triage decisions.

In many cases, people seem to prefer human advice to algorithms, but in others, there is a reversal, and people seem to prefer algorithmic advice. Across two studies, we examine the persuasiveness of, and judges' preferences for, advice from different sources when forecasting geopolitical events. We find that judges report domain-specific preferences, preferring human advice in the domain of politics and algorithmic advice in the domain of economics. In Study 2, participants report a preference for hybrid advice, that combines human and algorithmic sources, to either one on it's own regardless of domain. More importantly, we find that these preferences did not affect persuasiveness of advice from these different sources, regardless of domain.

Although human-robot collaborations can create new jobs and increase productivity, pundits often warn about how robots might replace humans at work and create mass unemployment. Despite these warnings, relatively little research has directly assessed how laypeople react to robots in the workplace. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory of stress, we suggest that employees exposed to robots (either physically or psychologically) would report greater job insecurity. Six studies-including two pilot studies, an archival study across 185 U.S. metropolitan areas (Study 1), a preregistered experiment conducted in Singapore (Study 2), an experience-sampling study among engineers conducted in India (Study 3), and an online experiment (Study 4)-find that increased exposure to robots leads to increased job insecurity. Study 3 also reveals that this robot-related job insecurity is in turn positively associated with burnout and workplace incivility.

We report the findings of a case study of demand forecasting in a pharmaceutical company over a 15-year period. At the start of the study, managers believed that they were making extensive use of their forecasting system that was marketed based on the accuracy of its advanced statistical methods. Yet most forecasts were obtained using the system's facility for judgmentally overriding the automatic statistical forecasts. Carrying out the judgmental interventions involved considerable management effort as part of a sales & operations planning (S&OP) process, yet these often only served to reduce forecast accuracy. This study uses observations of the forecasting process, interviews with participants and data on the accuracy of forecasts to investigate why the managers continued to use non-normative forecasting practices for many years despite the potential economic benefits that could be achieved through change. The reasons for the longevity of these practices are examined both from the perspective of the individual forecaster and the organization as a whole. (C) 2020 International Institute of Forecasters.

They also sometimes receive algorithmic advice, but often discount such advice. This usually results in less consistent and less accurate predictions than consistently using the advice. We hypothesized that individual differences on psychological traits such as dutifulness (a facet of conscientiousness), decision-making styles, and predictor validity beliefs are related to the consistent use of algorithmic advice, judgment consistency, and predictive validity. We sampled participants with hiring experience (N = 308) who predicted the performance of job ap-plicants based on test scores and interview ratings, and they also received algorithmic advice. The results showed that more dutiful participants and participants with more accurate predictor validity beliefs used the algorithm more, and made more consistent and more accurate predictions. We did not find evidence that an intuitive decision-making style was related to these outcomes. Exploratory analyses showed that cognitive ability was positively related to the consistent use of algorithmic advice and judgment consistency, but not significantly related to predictive validity. Furthermore, the other conscientiousness facets and the general factor were similarly related to the outcome variables as dutifulness.

However, there is a limited understanding about the interplay between these factors for teams, especially as applied to artificial intelligence (AI) technology. With the increasing integration of AI into human teams, we need to understand how environmental factors such as time scarcity interact with AI technology to affect team behaviors. To address this gap in the literature, we investigated the interaction between the availability of intelligent technology and time scarcity in teams. Drawing from the theoretical perspective of computers are social actors and extant research on the use of heuristics and human-AI interaction, this study uses behavioral data from 56 teams who participated in a between-subjects 2 (intelligent assistant available x control/no intelligent assistant) x 2 (time scarcity x control/no time scarcity) lab experiment. Results show that teams working under time scarcity used the intelligent assistant more often and underperformed on a creative task compared to teams without the temporal constraints.

ID-214,article,A longitudinal approach for understanding algorithm use,"Research suggests that algorithms-based on artificial intelligence or linear regression models-make better predictions than humans in a wide range of domains. Several studies have examined the degree to which people use algorithms. However, these studies have been mostly cross-sectional and thus have failed to address the dynamic nature of algorithm use. In the present paper, we examined algorithm use with a novel longitudinal approach outside the lab. Specifically, we conducted two ecological momentary assessment studies in which 401 participants made financial predictions for 18 days in two tasks. Relying on the judge-advisor system framework, we examined how time interacted with advice source (human vs. algorithm) and advisor accuracy to predict advice taking. Our results showed that when the advice was inaccurate, people tended to use algorithm advice less than human advice across the period studied. Inaccurate algorithms were penalized logarithmically; the effect was initially strong but tended to fade over time. This suggests that first impressions are crucial and produce significant changes in advice taking at the beginning of the interaction, which later tends to stabilize as days go by. Therefore, inaccurate algorithms are more likely to accrue a negative reputation than inaccurate humans, even when having the same level of performance.",https://content.ebscohost.com/cds/retrieve?content=AQICAHiylJ_bvOB56hI8UzTN6Ryruh7a0kiIBN_ANwtaWYjmxwGhCAhlrjHA5qzvq0tf8oTtAAAA4zCB4AYJKoZIhvcNAQcGoIHSMIHPAgEAMIHJBgkqhkiG9w0BBwEwHgYJYIZIAWUDBAEuMBEEDC1FNwwlRhT3oq__dwIBEICBm4AVO0_q_SboehIxXCiOsYwX4hq_kfVVZ-Etp0HHONw-FY1Gd1Drim2iSNvJ-qpZGRcIW0OwWkSUG4JF_ssnjqX8TdarY2v5J-fBQmaA0vnwZSOk9Izr4vjJQMptTDukxowZJGURUq0El03LPPXiawyDMj7UzDkpN5iYWiUSU-tNyllxS_vQyy_j-OUFB2SFS_mwXmWX2rWFU1Lx,1,1,1,,,,"how does algorithm use change over time? importance of first impressions. inaccurate algorithms are more likely to gain a negative reputation than inaccurate humans, even when they have the same overall performance",Alvaro Chacon and Edgar E Kausel and Tomas Reyes,doi.org/10.1002/bdm.2275,0894-3257,4,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DECISION MAKING,,,,,WOS:000746449600001,,35,,2022,,
ID-215,article,Machines versus humans: People's biased responses to traffic accidents involving self-driving vehicles,"Although self-driving vehicles (SDVs) bring with them the promise of improved traffic safety, they cannot eliminate all crashes. Little is known about whether people respond crashes involving SDVs and human drivers differently and why. Across five vignette-based experiments in two studies (total N = 1267), for the first time, we witnessed that participants had a tendency to perceive traffic crashes involving SDVs to be more severe than those involving conventionally human-driven vehicles (HDVs) regardless of their severity (injury or fatality) or cause (SDVs/HDVs or others). Furthermore, we found that this biased response could be a result of people's reliance on the affect heuristic. More specifically, higher prior negative affect tagged with an SDV (vs. an HDV) intensifies people's negative affect evoked by crashes involving the SDV (vs. those involving the HDV), which subsequently results in higher perceived severity and lower acceptability of the crash. Our results imply that people's over-reaction to crashes involving SDVs may be a psychological barrier to their adoption and that we may need to forestall a less stringent introduction policy that allows SDVs on public roads as it may lead to more crashes that could possibly deter people from adopting SDVs.

ID-216,article,"What shapes our attitudes towards algorithms in urban governance? The role of perceived friendliness and controllability of the city, and human-algorithm cooperation","Today, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are increasingly often implemented in urban management; however, so far, there has been no research on how their use can affect the perception of the city. Is a city employing algorithmic decision-making perceived as friendly and controllable? Will algorithms assisting city officials be more accepted than those making a decision without human supervision? And, is a city in which algorithms make decisions with city officials perceived as more friendly and controllable than a city in which algorithms make decisions unadvised? To address these questions, we have conducted two studies in Poland, representative for the population's age and gender structure. The first study results (N = 753) showed that individuals who perceived cities using algorithms as resident-unfriendly, were also more reluctant to accept algorithmic governance. The perceived controllability of the city was not related to the acceptance of algorithms. The second, experimental study (N = 1047) demonstrated that the acceptance of algorithms increased when they were presented as collaborating with humans (vs. making decisions unadvised). Cooperation between algorithms and humans also increased the perceived friendliness and controllability of the city. The studies provide evidence that imple-menting algorithms into urban governance can lead to a sense of alienation and lower the city's friendliness; however, collaboration between humans and algorithms may diminish this feeling and increase the overall acceptance of algorithmic decision making in the city.",,3,,,urban governance,warmth,,"attitudes influencing acceptance of AI in urban managements, resulting perceptions of friendleness in the city",Tomasz Oleksy and Anna Wnuk and Anna Domaradzka and Dominika Maison,doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2023.107653,0747-5632,,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,,,,,WOS:000961343000001,,142,,2023,,
ID-217,article,The autonomy-validity dilemma in mechanical prediction procedures: The quest for a compromise,"A robust finding in psychological research is that combining information with a mechanical rule results in more valid predictions than combining information holistically in the mind. Nevertheless, information is typically combined holistically in practice, resulting in suboptimal predictions and decisions. Earlier research showed that decision makers are more likely to use mechanical prediction procedures when they retain autonomy in the decision-making process. However, it remains largely unknown how different autonomy-enhancing features affect predictive validity. Therefore, in two preregistered studies (total N = 342), we investigated if and how prediction procedures can be designed such that they satisfy decision makers' autonomy needs and acceptance without reducing predictive validity. Based on archival application data from a university admission procedure, participants predicted applicants' first-year grade point average and chance of dropout. The results of Bayesian analyses showed that participants preferred prediction procedures in which they retained autonomy by choosing consistent predictor weights of a mechanical rule or by holistically adjusting the predictions of an optimal regression model. In general, these prediction procedures resulted in slightly higher predictive validity compared with fully holistic prediction. Providing participants with predictor validity information slightly increased predictive validity when participants could choose predictor weights but not when making holistic predictions or adjusting optimal model predictions. Giving decision makers a role in designing mechanical rules through choosing weights based on explicit predictive validity information could help promote the implementation and validity of mechanical prediction in practice.",,3,,,,,,,Marvin Neumann and A Susan M Niessen and Jorge N Tendeiro and Rob R Meijer,10.1002/bdm.2270,0894-3257,4,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DECISION MAKING,,,,,WOS:000725316000001,,35,,2022,,
ID-218,article,Explainable subgradient tree boosting for prescriptive analytics in operations management,"Motivated by the success of gradient boosting approaches in machine learning and driven by the need for explainable prescriptive analytics approaches in operations management (OM), we propose subgradient tree boosting (STB) as an explainable prescriptive analytics approach to solving convex stochastic optimization problems that frequently arise in OM. The STB approach combines the well-known method of subgradient descent in function space with sample average approximation, and prescribes decisions from a problem-specific loss function, historical demand observations, and prescriptive features. The approach provides a decision-maker with detailed explanations for the prescribed decisions, such as a breakdown of individual features' impact. These explanations are particularly valuable in practice when the decisionmaker has the discretion to adjust the recommendations made by a decision support system. We show how subgradients can be derived for common single-stage and two-stage stochastic optimization problems; demonstrate the STB approach's applicability to two real-world, complex capacity-planning problems in the service industry; benchmark the STB approach's performance against those of two prescriptive approaches-weighted sample average approximation (wSAA) and kernelized empirical risk minimization (kERM); and show how the STB approach's prescriptions can be explained by estimating the impact of individual features. The results suggest that the quality of the STB approach's prescriptions is comparable to that of wSAA's and kERM's prescriptions while also providing explanations. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID-219,article,A Study on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Decision Making : Focusing on Human-AI Collaboration and Decision-Maker’s Personality Trait,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key technology that will change the future the most. It affects the industry as a whole and daily life in various ways. As data availability increases, artificial intelligence finds an optimal solution and infers/predicts through self-learning. Research and investment related to automation that discovers and solves problems on its own are ongoing continuously. Automation of artificial intelligence has benefits such as cost reduction, minimization of human intervention and the difference of human capability. However, there are side effects, such as limiting the artificial intelligence’s autonomy and erroneous results due to algorithmic bias. In the labor market, it raises the fear of job replacement. Prior studies on the utilization of artificial intelligence have shown that individuals do not necessarily use the information (or advice) it provides. Algorithm error is more sensitive than human error; so, people avoid algorithms after seeing errors, which is called “algorithm aversion.” Recently, artificial intelligence has begun to be understood from the perspective of the augmentation of human intelligence. We have started to be interested in Human-AI collaboration rather than AI alone without human. A study of 1500 companies in various industries found that human-AI collaboration outperformed AI alone. In the medicine area, pathologist-deep learning collaboration dropped the pathologist cancer diagnosis error rate by 85%. Leading AI companies, such as IBM and Microsoft, are starting to adopt the direction of AI as augmented intelligence. Human-AI collaboration is emphasized in the decision-making process, because artificial intelligence is superior in analysis ability based on information. Intuition is a unique human capability so that human-AI collaboration can make optimal decisions. In an environment where change is getting faster and uncertainty increases, the need for artificial intelligence in decision-making will increase. In addition, active discussions are expected on approaches that utilize artificial intelligence for rational decision-making. This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence on decision-making focuses on human-AI collaboration and the interaction between the decision maker personal traits and advisor type. The advisors were classified into three types: human, artificial intelligence, and human-AI collaboration. We investigated perceived usefulness of advice and the utilization of advice in decision making and whether the decision-maker’s personal traits are influencing factors. Three hundred and eleven adult male and female experimenters conducted a task that predicts the age of faces in photos and the results showed that the advisor type does not directly affect the utilization of advice. The decision-maker utilizes it only when they believed advice can improve prediction performance. In the case of human-AI collaboration, decision-makers higher evaluated the perceived usefulness of advice, regardless of the decision maker's personal traits and the advice was more actively utilized. If the type of advisor was artificial intelligence alone, decision-makers who scored high in conscientiousness, high in extroversion, or low in neuroticism, high evaluated the perceived usefulness of the advice so they utilized advice actively. This study has academic significance in that it focuses on human-AI collaboration that the recent growing interest in artificial intelligence roles. It has expanded the relevant research area by considering the role of artificial intelligence as an advisor of decision-making and judgment research, and in aspects of practical significance, suggested views that companies should consider in order to enhance AI capability. To improve the effectiveness of AI-based systems, companies not only must introduce high-performance systems, but also need employees who properly understand digital information presented by AI, and can add non-digital information to make decisions. Moreover, to increase utilization in AI-based systems, ​task-oriented competencies, such as analytical skills and information technology capabilities, are important. in addition, it is expected that greater performance will be achieved if employee’s personal traits are considered.",,2,,,,,,,Lee jeongseon and Bomil Suh and Kwon， Young Ok,,2288-4866,3,Journal of Intelligence and Information Systems,,,,231-252,KJD:ART002765238,,27,,2021,,

Using an inductive data analysis rooted in the principles of grounded theory, the study uncovered four aggregate dimensions critical to understanding the role of AI in talent acquisition.FindingsWith insights from algorithmic management and ambidexterity theory, the study presents a comprehensive theoretical framework that highlights four aggregate dimensions describing AI's transformative role in talent recruitment. The results provide a cautionary perspective, advising against an excessive emphasis on operational performance driven solely by algorithmic management.Research limitations/implicationsThe study is limited in scope and subject to several constraints. Firstly, the sample size and diversity are restricted, as the findings are based on a limited number of semi-structured interviews and meetings with HRs professionals, recruiters, and AI hiring platform providers. Secondly, the rapid evolution of AI technologies means that the study's findings may quickly become outdated as new advancements and applications emerge.Practical implicationsThe results provide managers with actionable information that can lead to more precise and strategic management practices, ultimately contributing to improved organizational performance and outcomes. Plus, enhancing their ability to make informed decisions, optimize processes and address challenges effectively.Social implicationsThe results signal both positive and negative impacts on employment opportunities. On the positive side, AI can streamline recruitment processes, making it easier for qualified candidates to be identified and hired quickly. However, AI systems can also perpetuate existing biases present in the data they are trained on, leading to unfair hiring practices where certain groups are systematically disadvantaged.Originality/valueBy examining the balance between transactional efficiency and relational engagement, the research addresses a crucial trade-off that organizations face when implementing AI in recruitment.

This approach neglects relational aspects of increasingly capable automation and system-level outcomes, such as cooperation and resilience. To address these limitations, we adopt a relational framing of trust based on the decision situation, semiotics, interaction sequence, and strategy. This relational framework stresses that the goal is not to maximize trust, or to even calibrate trust, but to support a process of trusting through automation responsivity.ConclusionThis framing clarifies why future work on trust in automation should consider not just individual characteristics and how automation influences people, but also how people can influence automation and how interdependent interactions affect trusting automation. In these new technological and organizational contexts that shift human operators to co-operators of automation, automation responsivity and the ability to resolve conflicting goals may be more relevant than reliability and reliance for advancing system design.ApplicationA conceptual model comprising four concepts-situation, semiotics, strategy, and sequence-can guide future trust research and design for automation responsivity and more resilient human-automation systems.",,3,,,,,,,Erin K Chiou and John D Lee,10.1177/00187208211009995,0018-7208,1,HUMAN FACTORS,,,,137-165,WOS:000648412700001,,65,,2023,,
ID-222,article,Bending the Automation Bias Curve: A Study of Human and AI-Based Decision Making in National Security Contexts,"Uses of artificial intelligence (AI) are growing around the world. What will influence AI adoption in the international security realm? Research on automation bias suggests that humans can often be overconfident in AI, whereas research on algorithm aversion shows that, as the stakes of a decision rise, humans become more cautious about trusting algorithms. We theorize about the relationship between background knowledge about AI, trust in AI, and how these interact with other factors to influence the probability of automation bias in the international security context. We test these in a preregistered task identification experiment across a representative sample of 9,000 adults in nine countries with varying levels of AI industries. The results strongly support the theory, especially concerning AI background knowledge. A version of the Dunning-Kruger effect appears to be at play, whereby those with the lowest level of experience with AI are slightly more likely to be algorithm-averse, then automation bias occurs at lower levels of knowledge before leveling off as a respondent's AI background reaches the highest levels. Additional results show effects from the task's difficulty, overall AI trust, and whether a human or AI decision aid is described as highly competent or less competent.Los usos de la inteligencia artificial (IA) estan creciendo en todo el mundo.

Ponemos a prueba esta teoria mediante un experimento de identificacion de tareas prerregistrado con una muestra representativa de 9000 adultos en 9 paises con diferentes niveles de industrias de IA. Los resultados respaldan firmemente esta teoria, especialmente en lo que respecta a los conocimientos previos en materia de IA. Observamos que aqui entra en juego una version del efecto Dunning Kruger, segun el cual aquellos con el nivel mas bajo de experiencia con IA son ligeramente mas propensos a ser reacios a los algoritmos. Por lo tanto, el sesgo de automatizacion se produce en niveles mas bajos de conocimiento antes de estabilizarse a medida que los antecedentes con relacion a la IA de un encuestado alcanzan unos niveles mas altos. Los resultados adicionales muestran los efectos de la dificultad de cada tarea, de la confianza general en la IA y de si existe un humano o una ayuda para la toma de decisiones de la IA que se describan como altamente competentes o como menos competentes.Les utilisations de l'intelligence artificielle (IA) se developpent dans le monde entier. Quels seront les facteurs qui influenceront l'adoption de l'IA dans le domaine de la securite internationale ? La recherche sur les penchants pour l'automatisation suggere que les humains font souvent preuve d'une confiance excessive a l'egard de l'IA, alors que la recherche sur l'aversion aux algorithmes montre que, lorsque les enjeux d'une decision montent, les humains se montrent plus prudents quand il s'agit de faire confiance aux algorithmes. Nous formulons une theorie a propos de la relation entre les connaissances de fond quant a l'IA, la confiance envers l'IA et leurs interactions avec d'autres facteurs pour influencer la probabilite d'un penchant pour l'automatisation dans un contexte de securite internationale. Nous testons ces interactions dans une experience d'identification de taches preenregistrees appliquee a un echantillon de 9 000 adultes dans 9 pays dont le secteur de l'IA se trouve a des niveaux differents. Les resultats appuient fortement la theorie, notamment concernant les connaissances de fond sur l'IA. Une version de l'effet Dunning Kruger semblerait entrer en consideration : les personnes les moins experimentees avec l'IA ont legerement plus de chances de s'opposer aux algorithmes, puis le penchant pour l'automatisation intervient quand les connaissances sont legerement meilleures avant de se stabiliser quand l'experience de la personne sondee quant a l'IA atteint les niveaux les plus eleves.

ID-223,article,Evolution of technology investment and development of robotaxi services,"Using artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technologies, robotaxis are expected to provide more intelligent, efficient, sustainable, and convenient services as technology advances and market penetration increases. This requires attention to technology investment and market competition at the different stages of robotaxi development. This study aims to reveal the changing rules of R&D investment and market competition for robotaxi services at various stages, considering subsidies, passenger preferences (i.e. walking aversion, safety, additional convenience), and the volatility of benefits from congestion reduction. We developed models to capture the competition between robotaxis and traditional taxis in the three phases of market development - namely, introduction, development, and dominance. The results of this study show that the optimal level of R&D investment is affected by factors such as R&D subsidies, passenger preferences, and the volatility of congestion reduction benefits and that it decreases during the development phase and may further decline during the dominance phase. Additionally, government R&D subsidies should be maintained at a reasonable level to avoid potential strategic conflicts with companies in technology investment and adoption of robotaxi services during the introduction phase. The transition from R&D subsidies to usage subsidies will depend on reaching the perceived safety threshold for robotaxi services. Reducing congestion can play a role similar to the deployment of usage subsidies to promote robotaxi services during the development phase, and can promote R&D investment, robotaxi services, and firm profits in the dominance phase. However, these benefits may be reduced by the volatility of congestion reduction. Policy recommendations and strategies are provided to promote future technological progress and market competition.",,3,,,,,,,X Zhang and H J Sun and X Y Pei and L H Guan and Z H Wang,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103615,1366-5545,,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW,,,,,WOS:001257361100001,,188,,2024,,
ID-224,article,Majority voting of doctors improves appropriateness of AI reliance in pathology,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) making advancements in medical decision-making, there is a growing need to ensure doctors develop appropriate reliance on AI to avoid adverse outcomes. However, existing methods in enabling appropriate AI reliance might encounter challenges while being applied in the medical domain. With this regard, this work employs and provides the validation of an alternative approach - majority voting - to facilitate appropriate reliance on AI in medical decision-making. This is achieved by a multi-institutional user study involving 32 medical professionals with various backgrounds, focusing on the pathology task of visually detecting a pattern, mitoses, in tumor images. Here, the majority voting process was conducted by synthesizing decisions under AI assistance from a group of pathology doctors (pathologists). Two metrics were used to evaluate the appropriateness of AI reliance: Relative AI Reliance (RAIR) and Relative Self-Reliance (RSR). Results showed that even with groups of three pathologists, majority-voted decisions significantly increased both RAIR and RSR - by approximately 9% and 31%, respectively - compared to decisions made by one pathologist collaborating with AI. This increased appropriateness resulted in better precision and recall in the detection of mitoses. While our study is centered on pathology, we believe these insights can be extended to general high-stakes decision-making processes involving similar visual tasks.",,4,,,,,,improving appropriateness of doctor's reliance on AI,H Y Gu and C X Yang and S Magaki and N Zarrin-Khameh and N S Lakis and I Cobos and N Khanlou and X R Zhang and J Assi and J T Byers and A Hamza and K R Han and A Meyer and H Mirbaha and C A Mohila and T M Stevens and S L Stone and W Z Yan and M Haeri and X Chen,doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2024.103315,1071-5819,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES,,,,,WOS:001271214300001,,190,,2024,,
ID-225,article,Acceptance of artificial intelligence devices in banking services: moderation role of technology anxiety and risk aversion,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the acceptance of artificial intelligence devices (AIDs) by customers in banking service encounters using the Artificially Intelligent Device Use Acceptance (AIDUA) model and thus test the validity of the AIDUA model in the context of the banking sector as well as extending the AIDUA model by incorporating two moderator variables, namely technology anxiety and risk aversion by regarding the nature of banking services, which are considered highly risky and technology-intensive. Design/methodology/approach - About 575 valid face-to-face self-administered surveys were gathered using convenience sampling among real bank customers in Turkey. The structural equation modelling was used to test hypotheses involving both direct and moderation effects. Findings - The current study has demonstrated that the AIDUA model is valid and reliable for the acceptance of AIDs in banking service encounters by modifying it. The study results have shown that the acceptance process of AIDs for bank customers consists of three phases. Furthermore, the study's findings have demonstrated that technology anxiety and risk aversion have adverse moderation effects on the relationship between performance expectancy and emotion as well as on the relationship between emotion and willingness to accept AIDs, respectively. Originality/value - The current study validates the AIDUA model for the banking industry.

ID-226,article,Scoring the Ethics of AI Robo-Advice: Why We Need Gateways and Ratings,"Unlike the many services already transformed by artificial intelligence (AI), the financial advice sector remains committed to a human interface. That is surprising as an AI-powered financial advisor (a robo-advisor) can offer personalised financial advice at much lower cost than traditional human advice. This is particularly important for those who need but cannot afford or access traditional financial advice. Robo-advice is easily accessible, available on-demand, and pools all relevant information in finding and implementing an optimal financial plan. In a perfectly competitive market for financial advice, robo-advice should prevail. Unfortunately, this market is imperfect with asymmetric information causing generalised advice aversion with a disproportionate lack of trust in robo-advice. Initial distrust makes advice clients reluctant to use, or switch to, robo-advice. This paper investigates the ethical concerns specific to robo-advice underpinning this lack of trust. We propose a regulatory framework addressing these concerns to ensure robo-advice can be an ethical resource for good, resolving the increasing complexity of financial decision-making. Fit for purpose regulation augments initial trust in robo-advice and supports advice clients in discriminating between high-trust and low-trust robo-advisors. Aspiring robo-advisors need to clear four licensing gateways to qualify for an AI Robo-Advice License (AIRAL). Licensed robo-advisors should then be monitored for ethical compliance. Using a balanced score card for ethical performance generates an ethics rating. This gateways-and-ratings methodology builds trust in the robo-advisory market through improved transparency, reduced information asymmetry, and lower risk of adverse selection.",,3,,,,,,,P Kofman,10.1007/s10551-024-05753-5,0167-4544,,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS,,,,,WOS:001259368600001,,,,2024,,
ID-227,article,The Importance of Psychological Assessment in the Management of Bladder Pain Syndrome/Interstitial Cystitis and Vulvodynia: A Case Report,"This case report emphasizes the crucial role of psychological assessment in the management of patients with bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) and vulvodynia. A 48-year-old woman with a fiveyear history of refractory BPS/IC and vulvodynia presented with frequent urination, pelvic pain, and severe dyspareunia, which led to sexual aversion and divorce from her partner. Previous treatments, including lifestyle modifications, analgesics, anticholinergics, hydrodistension, intravesical dimethyl sulfoxide, and psychiatric interventions, had been ineffective. Psychological assessments using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 revealed severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and alexithymia. Due to the patient's sexual aversion and the absence of a partner, a complete Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) could not be administered. Instead, a partial FSFI and artificial intelligence-translated reference value of the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised were used to assess aspects relevant to the patient's condition. The patient underwent three monthly sessions of Fotona laser therapy, erbium, and neodymium laser at one-month intervals. Treatment outcomes were evaluated using the Numeric Rating Scale-11, Vulvodynia Total, Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index, and psychological assessment tools. At the six-month follow-up, all physical and psychological symptoms showed significant improvement and complete remission was achieved at 12 months. Despite the overall positive treatment outcomes, the patient's sexual aversion persisted, and accurate measurement was not possible, highlighting the complexity of addressing sexual function in patients with BPS/IC and vulvodynia.

ID-228,article,Attitudes toward artificial intelligence: combining three theoretical perspectives on technology acceptance,"Evidence on AI acceptance comes from a diverse field comprising public opinion research and largely experimental studies from various disciplines. Differing theoretical approaches in this research, however, imply heterogeneous ways of studying AI acceptance. The present paper provides a framework for systematizing different uses. It identifies three families of theoretical perspectives informing research on AI acceptance-user acceptance, delegation acceptance, and societal adoption acceptance. These models differ in scope, each has elements specific to them, and the connotation of technology acceptance thus changes when shifting perspective. The discussion points to a need for combining the three perspectives as they have all become relevant for AI. A combined approach serves to systematically relate findings from different studies. And as AI systems affect people in different constellations and no single perspective can accommodate them all, building blocks from several perspectives are needed to comprehensively study how AI is perceived in society.",,1,3,2,,,,"overview of the research on algorithm aversion. breaks down into (1) domains/disciplines, (2), context/task/stakes, (3) theoretical frameworks",P D Koenig,doi.org/10.1007/s00146-024-01987-z,0951-5666,,AI & SOCIETY,,,,,WOS:001242207100001,,,,2024,,

ID-230,article,Lasofoxifene as a potential treatment for aromatase inhibitor-resistant ER-positive breast cancer,"Background Breast cancers treated with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) can develop AI resistance, which is often driven by estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha/ESR1) activating mutations, as well as by ER-independent signaling pathways. The breast ER antagonist lasofoxifene, alone or combined with palbociclib, elicited antitumor activities in a xenograft model of ER + metastatic breast cancer (mBC) harboring ESR1 mutations. The current study investigated the activity of LAS in a letrozole-resistant breast tumor model that does not have ESR1 mutations.Methods Letrozole-resistant, MCF7 LTLT cells tagged with luciferase-GFP were injected into the mammary duct inguinal glands of NSG mice (MIND model; 6 mice/group). Mice were randomized to vehicle, lasofoxifene +/- palbociclib, fulvestrant +/- palbociclib, or palbociclib alone 2-3 weeks after cell injections. Tumor growth and metastases were monitored with in vivo and ex vivo luminescence imaging, terminal tumor weight measurements, and histological analysis. The experiment was repeated with the same design and 8-9 mice in each treatment group.Results Western blot analysis showed that the MCF7 LTLT cells had lower ER alpha and higher HER2 expressions compared with normal MCF7 cells. Lasofoxifene +/- palbociclib, but not fulvestrant, significantly reduced primary tumor growth versus vehicle as assessed by in vivo imaging of tumors at study ends. Percent tumor area in excised mammary glands was significantly lower for lasofoxifene plus palbociclib versus vehicle. Ki67 staining showed decreased overall tumor cell proliferation with lasofoxifene +/- palbociclib. The lasofoxifene + palbociclib combination was also associated with significantly fewer bone metastases compared with vehicle. Similar results were observed in the repeat experiment.Conclusions In a mouse model of letrozole-resistant breast cancer with no ESR1 mutations, reduced levels of ER alpha, and overexpression of HER2, lasofoxifene alone or combined with palbociclib inhibited primary tumor growth more effectively than fulvestrant. Lasofoxifene plus palbociclib also reduced bone metastases. These results suggest that lasofoxifene alone or combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor may offer benefits to patients who have ER-low and HER2-positive, AI-resistant breast cancer, independent of ESR1 mutations.",,3,,,,,,,M Lainé and M E Greene and J D Kurleto and G Bozek and T F Y Leng and R J Huggins and B S Komm and G L Greene,10.1186/s13058-024-01843-4,1465-5411,1,BREAST CANCER RESEARCH,,,,,WOS:001243623100001,,26,,2024,,

ID-234,article,Non-invasive real-time multimodal deception detection using machine learning and parallel computing techniques,"Detecting deception reliably has been a sought-after goal for researchers since the early twentieth century. This is due to its high stakes nature, especially when considering the setting under which a deception detection system would be utilized, such as law enforcement sectors, judicial bodies, and criminal investigation bodies. Therefore, recent literature has greatly focused on developing systems with ever increasing accuracies to minimize false positives. Attempts to diversify the sources of data being analyzed and classified as well as the reliance on artificial intelligence technologies have shown great success. But little attention was paid to the applicability of these systems in real-life scenarios. An idle deception detection system needs to exhibit accuracy but also perform in real-time, a feature that is lacking in the current state-of-the-art. In this work, a non-invasive real-time multimodal deception detection system is developed using advanced machine learning techniques. It combines data sources from video and audio streams to extract visual, acoustic, and linguistic features. It also utilizes parallel computing techniques to ensure high performance adequate for real-time usage. Furthermore, a user-friendly graphical user interface was built to facilitate the use of the system. Multiple experiments were conducted to determine its accuracy under various circumstances and combinations of features, the system had a detection accuracy of 99.83% under real-life, high-stakes scenarios using visual and acoustic features, and 91.03% accuracy under controlled environments, while an 89.54% accuracy was achieved using mixed environments and using visual, acoustic, and linguistic features.",,3,,,,,,,F Abdulridha and B M Albaker,10.1007/s13278-024-01255-4,1869-5450,1,SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING,,,,,WOS:001215435200001,,14,,2024,,

ID-236,article,Large Language Models and User Trust: Consequence of Self-Referential Learning Loop and the Deskilling of Health Care Professionals,"As the health care industry increasingly embraces large language models (LLMs), understanding the consequence of this integration becomes crucial for maximizing benefits while mitigating potential pitfalls. This paper explores the evolving relationship among clinician trust in LLMs, the transition of data sources from predominantly human -generated to artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content, and the subsequent impact on the performance of LLMs and clinician competence. One of the primary concerns identified in this paper is the LLMs' self -referential learning loops, where AI -generated content feeds into the learning algorithms, threatening the diversity of the data pool, potentially entrenching biases, and reducing the efficacy of LLMs. While theoretical at this stage, this feedback loop poses a significant challenge as the integration of LLMs in health care deepens, emphasizing the need for proactive dialogue and strategic measures to ensure the safe and effective use of LLM technology. Another key takeaway from our investigation is the role of user expertise and the necessity for a discerning approach to trusting and validating LLM outputs. The paper highlights how expert users, particularly clinicians, can leverage LLMs to enhance productivity by off-loading routine tasks while maintaining a critical oversight to identify and correct potential inaccuracies in AI -generated content. This balance of trust and skepticism is vital for ensuring that LLMs augment rather than undermine the quality of patient care. We also discuss the risks associated with the deskilling of health care professionals. Frequent reliance on LLMs for critical tasks could result in a decline in health care providers' diagnostic and thinking skills, particularly affecting the training and development of future professionals. The legal and ethical considerations surrounding the deployment of LLMs in health care are also examined. We discuss the medicolegal challenges, including liability in cases of erroneous diagnoses or treatment advice generated by LLMs. The paper references recent legislative efforts, such as The Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2023, as crucial steps toward establishing a framework for the ethical and responsible use of AI -based technologies in health care. In conclusion, this paper advocates for a strategic approach to integrating LLMs into health care. By emphasizing the importance of maintaining clinician expertise, fostering critical engagement with LLM outputs, and navigating the legal and ethical landscape, we can ensure that LLMs serve as valuable tools in enhancing patient care and supporting health care professionals. This approach addresses the immediate challenges posed by integrating LLMs and sets a foundation for their maintainable and responsible use in the future.",,3,,,,,,,A Choudhury and Z Chaudhry,10.2196/56764,1438-8871,,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,,,,,WOS:001223117600002,,26,,2024,,

ID-239,article,"Comprehension, apprehension, and acceptance: Understanding the influence of literacy and anxiety on acceptance of artificial Intelligence","In this paper, we discuss how people's attitudes toward accepting Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are influenced by their self-reported literacy (i.e., their understanding and ability to use AI technology) and anxiety (i.e., their fear of the AI technology's impact on society). We conducted an anonymous survey, gathering 313 valid responses, and utilized Structural Equation Modelling to examine the relationships between these factors. Our model incorporates the constructs of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to provide a more comprehensive overview of AI acceptance. Our findings indicate that while literacy fosters a positive attitude towards acceptance, anxiety has a minimal, although significant, direct negative effect, but plays a significant role in mediating the influence of literacy. Specifically, learning and sociotechnical dimensions of AI anxiety serves as a complementary partial mediator between AI literacy and acceptance, meaning that a portion of the effect of literacy on acceptance is mediated through AI anxiety. In contrast, literacy still explains a portion of acceptance independent from anxiety. Our study also confirms that dimensions of technology acceptance, as suggested by TAM, significantly shape individuals' attitudes towards AI as for others digital technology. In this respect, AI literacy positively influences the perception of ease of use and usefulness, thereby contributing to the overall acceptance of AI-based technology.

ID-242,article,Not a good judge of talent: the influence of subjective socioeconomic status on AI aversion,The current research constructs a framework to understand how subjective socioeconomic status (SES) affects consumers' AI aversion in the evaluation context. Three experiments show that subjective SES has a negative impact on consumers' willingness to accept AI evaluation. Consumers with higher subjective SES are more likely to resist AI evaluation because they perceive that AI agents are not as capable as human agents of identifying their talents. This effect is moderated by the agent type-the impact of subjective SES on resistance to the AI agent is attenuated when the AI agent is non-evaluative.

They feature interactions among people applying technologies to enact roles within mission-oriented collectives. As sociotechnical systems, military institutions can be examined through the lens of complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory. This discussion applies the CAS perspective to reveal implications of integrating newer artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into military decision-making institutions. I begin by arguing that military adoption of AI is well-incentivised by the current defence landscape. Given these incentives, it would be useful to try to understand the likely effects of AI integration into military decision-making. Direct examinations of the new affordances and risks of new AI models is a natural mode of analysis for this. I discuss some low-hanging fruit in this tradition. However, I also maintain that such examinations can miss systemic impacts of AI reliance in decision-making workflows.

They include the integration of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) to augment cognitive functions, the application of gene editing, and the utilization of AI-powered robotic exoskeletons to enhance physical strength. This study employs a comprehensive analytical framework combining factor analysis, clustering, ANOVA, and logistic regression to investigate public attitudes toward these transformative technologies. Our findings reveal three distinct clusters of public opinion reflecting varying optimism and concern toward AI technologies. Cluster 1 (1574 participants) held a positive view with high excitement while Cluster 2 (1334 participants) showed a balanced stance. Cluster 3 (2199 participants) expressed heightened concern despite some excitement. Notably, regional disparities, particularly between urban and rural participants, emerge as a prominent factor influencing these attitudes (ANOVA, F = 15.2, p < 0.001). Furthermore, logistic regression identifies key influencers of public perception, highlighting the significant roles played by religion and regional factors. The implications of these findings extend beyond understanding public sentiment.

ID-250,article,Informing Machine Perception With Psychophysics,"Gustav Fechner's 1860 delineation of psychophysics, the measurement of sensation in relation to its stimulus, is widely considered to be the advent of modern psychological science. In psychophysics, a researcher parametrically varies some aspects of a stimulus and measures the resulting changes in a human subject's experience of that stimulus; doing so gives insight into the determining relationship between a sensation and the physical input that evoked it. This approach is used heavily in perceptual domains, including signal detection, threshold measurement, and ideal observer analysis. Scientific fields, such as vision science, have always leaned heavily on the methods and procedures of psychophysics, but there is now growing appreciation of them by machine learning researchers, sparked by widening overlap between biological and artificial perception [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].

However, with over ten thousand bird species described globally, accurate identification based solely on their appearances poses a challenge, even for experienced bird watchers, leading to potential discrepancies in species classification. This difficulty highlights the challenges that both human intelligence and artificial intelligence encounter when accurately identifying bird species. To address this challenge, we propose an automatic bird species classification system using deep learning techniques. Our study leverages the power of deep learning in computer vision to assist novice bird enthusiasts in accurately identifying the plethora of bird species they encounter. We gathered and utilized a diverse dataset of bird images to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Our classification system, developed through training and careful evaluation has shown accuracy, in identifying different bird species using images. This system serves as a tool in real world situations allowing bird enthusiasts to gain an appreciation for the diverse range of avian species and actively contribute to conservation efforts. Our classification system, which has been extensively trained and thoroughly evaluated has proven to be highly accurate, in identifying bird species based on images. It provides a tool for bird enthusiasts to truly appreciate the range of avian species and contribute to conservation efforts. Our research introduces an efficient approach, based on learning for automatically classifying bird species from images. This addresses the challenges faced by both experts and non experts in identifying birds.

ID-252,article,A formalism for extracting track functions from jet measurements,"The continued success of the jet substructure program will require widespread use of tracking information to enable increasingly precise measurements of a broader class of observables. The recent reformulation of jet substructure in terms of energy correlators has simplified the incorporation of universal non-perturbative matrix elements, so called ""track functions"", in jet substructure calculations. These advances make it timely to understand how these universal non-perturbative functions can be extracted from hadron collider data, which is complicated by the use jet algorithms. In this paper we introduce a new class of jet functions, which we call (semi-inclusive) track jet functions, which describe measurements of the track energy fraction in identified jets. These track jet functions can be matched onto the universal track functions, with perturbatively calculable matching coefficients that incorporate the jet algorithm dependence. We perform this matching, and present phenomenological results for the charged energy fraction in jets at the LHC and EIC/HERA at collinear next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We show that higher moments of the charged energy fraction directly exhibit non-linear Lorentzian renormalization group flows, allowing the study of these flows with collider data.

Inquiries into this subject are crucial to understanding human decision-making processes as in the era of artificial intelligence, algorithms are increasingly being integrated into decision-making. To contribute to this evolving field, this study examines three factors that might play significant roles in enhancing trust in algorithms: familiarity with algorithms, familiarity with tasks, and familiarity with algorithm performance. Drawing upon prior studies, a conceptual model was developed and empirically tested using a scenario study. Data on 327 individuals showed a strong positive association between familiarity with algorithms and trust in algorithms. In contrast, task familiarity appeared to have no significant influence on trust. Trust, in turn, was identified as a key driver of algorithm appreciation. The study also revealed the moderating role of familiarity with algorithm performance in the relationship between familiarity with algorithms and trust in algorithms. Post hoc analysis highlighted that trust fully mediates the relationship between algorithm familiarity and algorithm appreciation.

AI-assisted approach,"Aims: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical decision-making for benzodiazepine deprescribing between a healthcare provider (HCP) and an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot GPT4 (ChatGPT-4).Methods: We analysed real-world data from a Croatian cohort of community-dwelling benzodiazepine patients (n = 154) within the EuroAgeism H2020 ESR 7 project. HCPs evaluated the data using pre-established deprescribing criteria to assess benzodiazepine discontinuation potential. The research team devised and tested AI prompts to ensure consistency with HCP judgements. An independent researcher employed ChatGPT-4 with predetermined prompts to simulate clinical decisions for each patient case. Data derived from human-HCP and ChatGPT-4 decisions were compared for agreement rates and Cohen's kappa.Results: Both HPC and ChatGPT identified patients for benzodiazepine deprescribing (96.1% and 89.6%, respectively), showing an agreement rate of 95% (kappa = .200, P = .012). Agreement on four deprescribing criteria ranged from 74.7% to 91.3% (lack of indication kappa = .352, P < .001; prolonged use kappa = .088, P = .280; safety concerns kappa = .123, P = .006; incorrect dosage kappa = .264, P = .001). Important limitations of GPT-4 responses were identified, including 22.1% ambiguous outputs, generic answers and inaccuracies, posing inappropriate decision-making risks.Conclusions: While AI-HCP agreement is substantial, sole AI reliance poses a risk for unsuitable clinical decision-making.

However, beyond these proof-of-concepts and the promise of automation they hold, a deeper understanding of the behaviour and use of these advanced algorithms by the process engineer is still needed. In this paper, we provide the first data-driven solution for designing supercritical CO2 power cycle for waste heat recovery, a challenging industrial use case with lack of consensus on the optimal layout from the field literature. We then examine the issue of artificial intelligence acceptance by the process engineer, and formulate a set of basic requirements to foster user acceptance - robustness, control, understanding of the results, small time-to-solution. The numerical experiments confirm the robustness of the method, able to produce optimal designs performing as well as a set of selected expert layouts, yet only from the specification of the unit operations (turbomachinery and heat exchangers). We provide tools to exploit the vast amount of generated data, with pattern mining techniques to extract heuristic rules, thereby explaining the decision-making process.

ID-263,article,An introduction to artificial intelligence in machine vision for postharvest detection of disorders in horticultural products,"Horticultural products may suffer from surface, subsurface, and internal disorders. These lower the market value and may lead to consumer dissatisfaction. Today's postharvest industry has a high interest in implementing technologies that allow efficient sorting of disordered products to avoid food loss, and to improve market value and consumer appreciation. Inspection by machine vision using RGB imaging and more advanced techniques such as spectral cameras, X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is increasingly implemented to nondestructively analyze disorders in horticultural products. However, for objective, robust and reliable detection of symptoms of disorders that are often even not obvious to detect by human vision, powerful data analysis methods are essential. In recent years, image analysis by artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved from traditional machine learning (ML) to advanced deep learning (DL), which is reaching impressive detection abilities. The aim of this article is to introduce recent developments in AI for extracting information on postharvest disorders from complex image data obtained by modern imaging systems to the non-AI expert. The main progress in AI for postharvest applications is the increasing adoption of available convolutional neural networks (CNNs), usually developed and tested with large open source image datasets elsewhere, to postharvest image data. Challenges in the design of DL models are identified, such as the need for large quantities of (labeled) data, the model explainability, and generalizability. Although proposed innovations often result in excellent detection abilities, their usability in an industrial context should be further considered, where uncontrollable parameters may negatively impact the performance.",,3,,,,,,,A Tempelaere and B De Ketelaere and J Q He and I Kalfas and M Pieters and W Saeys and R Van Belleghem and L Van Doorselaer and P Verboven and B M Nicolaï,10.1016/j.postharvbio.2023.112576,0925-5214,,POSTHARVEST BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY,,,,,WOS:001082117100001,,206,,2023,,
ID-264,article,Choosing human over AI doctors? How comparative trust associations and knowledge relate to risk and benefit perceptions of AI in healthcare,"The development of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is accelerating rapidly. Beyond the urge for technological optimization, public perceptions and preferences regarding the application of such technologies remain poorly understood. Risk and benefit perceptions of novel technologies are key drivers for successful implementation. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the factors that condition these perceptions. In this study, we draw on the risk perception and human-AI interaction literature to examine how explicit (i.e., deliberate) and implicit (i.e., automatic) comparative trust associations with AI versus physicians, and knowledge about AI, relate to likelihood perceptions of risks and benefits of AI in healthcare and preferences for the integration of AI in healthcare. We use survey data (N = 378) to specify a path model. Results reveal that the path for implicit comparative trust associations on relative preferences for AI over physicians is only significant through risk, but not through benefit perceptions. This finding is reversed for AI knowledge. Explicit comparative trust associations relate to AI preference through risk and benefit perceptions. These findings indicate that risk perceptions of AI in healthcare might be driven more strongly by affect-laden factors than benefit perceptions, which in turn might depend more on reflective cognition. Implications of our findings and directions for future research are discussed considering the conceptualization of trust as heuristic and dual-process theories of judgment and decision-making. Regarding the design and implementation of AI-based healthcare technologies, our findings suggest that a holistic integration of public viewpoints is warranted.",,1,1,1,healthcare,,,offered 5 options for preference from 1 = human physician only to 5 = AI only,S Kerstan and N Bienefeld and G Grote,doi.org/10.1111/risa.14216,0272-4332,4,RISK ANALYSIS,,,,939-957,WOS:001067663000001,,44,,2024,,
ID-265,article,Partisan Media Sentiment Toward Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming pervasive across society. However, its deployment appears to be a divisive issue. This research examines aversion to AI across the partisan divide. We analyze partisan media sentiment toward AI, a powerful driver of public opinion toward social issues. We conduct a text analysis of media articles on AI (N = 7,840) from several liberal-leaning and conservative-leaning media outlets. The results demonstrate that liberal-leaning media show a greater aversion to AI than conservative-leaning media. Furthermore, a mediation analysis suggests that liberal-leaning media are more concerned with AI magnifying social biases in society than conservative-leaning media, which drives the partisan media differences. Moreover, the results also show that media sentiment toward AI became more negative after George Floyd's death, an event that heightened sensitivity about social biases in society. Implications for how these partisan media differences can polarize public opinion and policymaker support toward AI are discussed.",,3,,,,,,,A E L Yi and S Goenka and M Pandelaere,10.1177/19485506231196817,1948-5506,,SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY SCIENCE,,,,,WOS:001065897300001,,,,2023,,
ID-266,article,Acceptance of AI in Semi-Structured Decision-Making Situations Applying the Four-Sides Model of Communication-An Empirical Analysis Focused on Higher Education,"This study investigates the impact of generative AI systems like ChatGPT on semi-structured decision-making, specifically in evaluating undergraduate dissertations. We propose using Davis' technology acceptance model (TAM) and Schulz von Thun's four-sides communication model to understand human-AI interaction and necessary adaptations for acceptance in dissertation grading. Utilizing an inductive research design, we conducted ten interviews with respondents having varying levels of AI and management expertise, employing four escalating-consequence scenarios mirroring higher education dissertation grading. In all scenarios, the AI functioned as a sender, based on the four-sides model. Findings reveal that technology acceptance for human-AI interaction is adaptive but requires modifications, particularly regarding AI's transparency. Testing the four-sides model showed support for three sides, with the appeal side receiving negative feedback for AI acceptance as a sender. Respondents struggled to accept the idea of AI, suggesting a grading decision through an appeal. Consequently, transparency about AI's role emerged as vital. When AI supports instructors transparently, acceptance levels are higher. These results encourage further research on AI as a receiver and the impartiality of AI decision-making without instructor influence. This study emphasizes communication modes in learning-ecosystems, especially in semi-structured decision-making situations with AI as a sender, while highlighting the potential to enhance AI-based decision-making acceptance.",,3,,,,,,,C Greiner and T C Peisl and F Höpfl and O Beese,10.3390/educsci13090865,2227-7102,9,EDUCATION SCIENCES,,,,,WOS:001073053500001,,13,,2023,,
ID-267,article,Assessing Adherence to Adjuvant Hormone Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients in Routine Clinical Practice,"Background: Adjuvant hormone therapy (HT) in patients with hor-mone receptor-positive breast cancer (BC) increases overall survival (OS). A lack of adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy is common, 31.0-73.0% of women discontinue endocrine treatment before 5 years. The aim of the study was to assess adherence to HT in routine clini-cal practice in patients assisted at the Clinical Oncology Department of the Hospital de Clinicas -Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay.Methods: Patients treated with HT for stage 0-III BC between 2017 and 2019 were included. The medication possession (MPR) rate was calculated using pharmacy records, and the Morisky-Green Scale was applied to assess adherence. Adherent patients were those with MPR & GE; 0.80 and who correctly answered the Morisky-Green treatment ad-herence questionnaire. The association of adherence with polyphar-macy, treatment, and patient characteristics was assessed using sim-ple logistic models. The associations between qualitative variables and adherence were assessed using simple logistic regression model or Fisher's exact test. The association between quantitative variables and adherence was assessed using the Student's t-test. The odds ratio (OR) for non-adherence to treatment and its 95% confidence interval were estimated.Results: Totally, 118 patients were included; 65.2% were treated with aromatase inhibitors (AIs), 36.0% presenting polypharmacy. The ad-herence rate at the end of 2 years was 81.0 %; and it was associ-ated with age (P = 0.03, OR = 0.96 for non-adherence), with adherent and non-adherent patients having a mean age of 65.0 and 60.3 years, respectively; however, adherence was not associated with polyphar-macy, territory of origin, marital status, living alone, level of educa-tion, occupation, or stage. The adherence profile was similar for both drugs, but homemakers and retired women showed greater adherence to AI.Conclusions: Adherence to HT was assessed in real life, with 19.0% of the patients not adhering to the treatment, despite the known ben-efit for OS, being a well-tolerated treatment, and being provided free of charge. Older patients were associated with being more adherent. The results show the need of the Pharmacy Service and Department of Clinical Oncology Medical Oncology combining efforts to develop coordinated strategies and interventions to increase adherence, given the impact that this may have on patients' OS.",,3,,,,,,,N Camejo and C Castillo and C Tambasco and N Strazzarino and N Requena and S Peraza and A Boronat and G Herrera and P Esperon and M Cuello and G Krygier,10.14740/wjon1647,1920-4531,4,WORLD JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY,,,,300-308,WOS:001047589600008,,14,,2023,,
ID-268,article,The application of semantic modelling to map pollination service provisioning at large landscape scales,"Mapping ecosystem services (ES), including crop pollination by wild insect pollinators, is challenging due to the number of variables involved and the spatial-temporal dimensions of their interactions. To enhance the synergistic relationship between pollination service and crop yield in agricultural landscapes, a better appreciation of the spatial dynamics of pollination service provisioning is needed. Spatially explicit modelling approaches have been used to investigate how different land cover types influence the distribution and abundance of wild bee pollinators in agricultural landscapes. However, an integrated dynamic and spatial modelling framework is needed to address the complexities of pollination supply mapping at the landscape scale. The Artificial Intelligence for Environment and Sustainability (ARIES) framework is a collaborative, spatially explicit and integrated tool for ES assessment. We applied a set of high-resolution process-based pollination models within ARIES to represent landscape capacity to supply pollination by wild bees at the local scale in the Canadian prairies. We also developed a systematic approach to perform a global sensitivity analysis by using a surrogate model (Gaussian Process Regression) and variance-based sensitivity analysis for the selected uncertain key parameters of the model. We modelled pollination dynamics through the mechanistic behavior of native bee guilds, including foraging distance, nesting ability, flight activity, the relative importance of bee guilds, and seasonal variation of floral resources. We focused on three guilds, bumblebees, sweat bees and mining bees, which differed by their nesting habits, floral preferences, and flight distances. We found that over 45% of pollinationdependent croplands in our study area lack wild pollination. The global sensitivity analysis revealed the significance of all key parameters, with seasonal activity across guilds identified as the key driving factors. Our results highlight the significance of the ecological role of wild bees in agricultural landscapes and the sensitivity analysis underscores the importance of temporal dynamics in ecological modeling and pollination.",,3,,,,,,,E Pashanejad and H Thierry and B E Robinson and L Parrott,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2023.110452,0304-3800,,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,,,WOS:001048326200001,,484,,2023,,

(AI Soc 35:611-623, 2020) and Lee (Big Data Soc 5:1-16, 2018), this empirical study uses two scenario-based online experiments. The sample consists of 221 subjects from Germany, differing in both age and gender. The original studies are not replicated one-to-one. New scenarios are constructed as realistically as possible and focused on everyday work situations. They are based on the AI acceptance model of Scheuer (Grundlagen intelligenter KI-Assistenten und deren vertrauensvolle Nutzung. Springer, Wiesbaden, 2020) and are extended by individual descriptive elements of AI systems in comparison to the original studies. The first online experiment examines decisions made by artificial intelligence with varying degrees of impact. In the high-impact scenario, applicants are automatically selected for a job and immediately received an employment contract. In the low-impact scenario, three applicants are automatically invited for another interview. In addition, the relationship between age and risk perception is investigated. The second online experiment tests subjects' perceived trust in decisions made by artificial intelligence, either semi-automatically through the assistance of human experts or fully automatically in comparison. Two task types are distinguished. The task type that requires ""human skills""-represented as a performance evaluation situation-and the task type that requires ""mechanical skills""-represented as a work distribution situation. In addition, the extent of negative emotions in automated decisions is investigated. The results are related to the findings of Araujo et al.

ID-270,article,Using soft maximin for risk averse multi-objective decision-making,"Balancing multiple competing and conflicting objectives is an essential task for any artificial intelligence tasked with satisfying human values or preferences. Conflict arises both from misalignment between individuals with competing values, but also between conflicting value systems held by a single human. Starting with principle of loss-aversion, we designed a set of soft maximin function approaches to multi-objective decision-making. Bench-marking these functions in a set of previously-developed environments, we found that one new approach in particular, 'split-function exp-log loss aversion' (SFELLA), learns faster than the state of the art thresholded alignment objective method Vamplew (Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligenceg 100:104186, 2021) on three of four tasks it was tested on, and achieved the same optimal performance after learning. SFELLA also showed relative robustness improvements against changes in objective scale, which may highlight an advantage dealing with distribution shifts in the environment dynamics. We further compared SFELLA to the multi-objective reward exponentials (MORE) approach, and found that SFELLA performs similarly to MORE in a simple previously-described foraging task, but in a modified foraging environment with a new resource that was not depleted as the agent worked, SFELLA collected more of the new resource with very little cost incurred in terms of the old resource. Overall, we found SFELLA useful for avoiding problems that sometimes occur with a thresholded approach, and more reward-responsive than MORE while retaining its conservative, loss-averse incentive structure.",,3,,,,,,,B J Smith and R Klassert and R Pihlakas,10.1007/s10458-022-09586-2,1387-2532,1,AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS,,,,,WOS:000902000500001,,37,,2023,,

ID-272,article,Paving the way for technological innovation through adoption of artificial intelligence in conservative industries,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a distinct form of ICT, revolutionizing manufacturing to the fourth industrial revolution. However, inherently complex and time-constrained operations restrict conservative industries from embracing AI transformation, leading to technological innovation. This study attempts to pave the way for AI transformation (leading to technological innovation) in conservative industries by developing and testing a value-based theoretical AI adoption framework. The proposed framework incorporates functional and conditional values as predictors to assess the industrial AI's fitness to the conservative industry need. Service reliability is taken as a moderator to assess AI acceptance's intention impact on its consistent use in routine operations in conservative industries. The model was tested in the construction and oil gas industries. A total number of 480 samples were collected from Pakistan. The results have indicated functional value as a significant predictor of the way forward with AI transformation in conservative industries. The other process variables like price value and performance expectancy have shown what drives AI acceptance intention in a conservative industry. The results also found service reliability as a necessity for the sustained use of AI in conservative industries. The findings provide useful insights for industrial AI companies on how such conservative industries envisage AI as a technological innovation and a potential solution to their problem.

Four Hong Kong secondary school students attended workshops where they learned to write stories comprising their own words and words generated by NLG tools. After the workshops, they answered questions to reflect on their writing experience with NLG tools. In a thematic analysis of the written reflections, we found students may have existing ideas when searching for ideas and evaluating ideas with NLG tools. Students showed some aversion to ideas generated by NLG tools and selected NLG tools that generated a greater quantity of ideas. The findings inform our understanding of EFL students' concerns when using NLG tools for idea generation and can inform educators' instruction to implement NLG tools for classroom creative writing.",,3,,,,,,,D J Woo and Y Z Wang and H Susanto and K Guo,10.1177/07356331231175999,0735-6331,7,JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH,,,,1464-1482,WOS:001000994100001,,61,,2023,,

In the education discourse, interest in artificial intelligence has sparked various reactions and controversies-everything from appreciation for AI's capabilities to make teaching and student learning more efficient and effective to apprehension about their potential overuse and misuse. In this article, the authors discuss how artificial intelligence is a double-edged sword in early childhood education by presenting some of its positive effects (personalized learning, personalized interactive support, and increased accessibility to broadened learning experiences) and negative effects (overuse and misuse). Considering that young children are growing up in a nearly AI-ubiquitous world and are likely exposed to AI-powered tools, the authors propose applying the POWER (purposeful, optimal, wise, ethical, responsible) principles to maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of AI use.

The mechanism of inter-firm cooperation is increasingly being altered by radical developments in blockchains and artificial intelligence among other technologies. To capture and address this shift, this review takes a problematisation approach and focuses wholly on the pertinence of agency theory. First, it begins by acknowledging the established corpus in the area before, second, appraising the seven long-held assumptions in the principal-agent relationship encompassing (1) self-interest, (2) conflicting goals, (3) boun-ded rationality, (4) information asymmetry, (5) pre-eminence of efficiency, (6) risk aversion and (7) information as a commodity. Third, to add a fresh perspective, the review proceeds to proffer seven assumptions to advance a novel 'Blockchain Agency Theory' that would better describe new attributes and relaxed agency behaviour in blockchain alliances. These counter assumptions are (1) common interests, (2) congruent goals, (3) unbounded rationality, (4) information symmetry, (5) smart contracts, (6) mean risk and (7) information availability. In the fourth part, the prior audience of principals and agents is appraised and this culminates into, fifth, a consider-ation of a new audience of blockchain agency in algocratic environments.

ID-276,article,"Evaluating Research Impact Based on Semantic Scholar Highly Influential Citations, Total Citations, and Altmetric Attention Scores: The Quest for Refined Measures Remains Illusive","Background: The evaluation of scholarly articles' impact has been heavily based on the citation metrics despite the limitations of this approach. Therefore, the quest for meticulous and refined measures to evaluate publications' impact is warranted. Semantic Scholar (SS) is an artificial intelligence-based database that allegedly identifies influential citations defined as ""Highly Influential Citations"" (HICs). Citations are considered highly influential according to SS when the cited publication has a significant impact on the citing publication (i.e., the citer uses or extends the cited work). Altmetrics are measures of online attention to research mined from activity in online tools and environments. Aims: The current study aimed to explore whether SS HICs provide an added value when it comes to measuring research impact compared to total citation counts and Altmetric Attention Score (AAS). Methods: Dimensions was used to generate the dataset for this study, which included COVID-19-related scholarly articles published by researchers affiliated to Jordanian institutions. Altmetric Explorer was selected as an altmetrics harvesting tool, while Semantic Scholar was used to extract details related to HICs. A total of 618 publications comprised the final dataset. Results: Only 4.57% (413/9029) of the total SS citations compiled in this study were classified as SS HICs. Based on SS categories of citations intent, 2626 were background citations (29.08%, providing historical context, justification of importance, and/or additional information related to the cited paper), 358 were result citations (3.97%, that extend on findings from research that was previously conducted), and 263 were method citations (2.91%, that use the previously established procedures or experiments to determine whether the results are consistent with findings in related studies). No correlation was found between HICs and AAS (r = 0.094). Manual inspection of the results revealed substantial contradictions, flaws, and inconsistencies in the SS HICs tool. Conclusions: The use of SS HICs in gauging research impact is significantly limited due to the enigmatic method of its calculation and total dependence on artificial intelligence. Along with the already documented drawbacks of total citation counts and AASs, continuous evaluation of the existing tools and the conception of novel approaches are highly recommended to improve the reliability of publication impact assessment.",,3,,,,,,,L A Dardas and M Sallam and A Woodward and N Sweis and N Sweis and F A Sawair,10.3390/publications11010005,2304-6775,1,PUBLICATIONS,,,,,WOS:000958128900001,,11,,2023,,
ID-277,article,Calibration of quantum decision theory: aversion to large losses and predictability of probabilistic choices,"We present the first calibration of quantum decision theory (QDT) to a dataset of binary risky choice. We quantitatively account for the fraction of choice reversals between two repetitions of the experiment, using a probabilistic choice formulation in the simplest form without model assumption or adjustable parameters. The prediction of choice reversal is then refined by introducing heterogeneity between decision makers through their differentiation into two groups: 'majoritarian' and 'contrarian' (in proportion 3:1). This supports the first fundamental tenet of QDT, which models choice as an inherent probabilistic process, where the probability of a prospect can be expressed as the sum of its utility and attraction factors. We propose to parameterize the utility factor with a stochastic version of cumulative prospect theory (logit-CPT), and the attraction factor with a constant absolute risk aversion function. For this dataset, and penalising the larger number of QDT parameters via the Wilks test of nested hypotheses, the QDT model is found to perform significantly better than logit-CPT at both the aggregate and individual levels, and for all considered fit criteria for the first experiment iteration and for predictions (second 'out-of-sample' iteration). The distinctive QDT effect captured by the attraction factor is mostly appreciable (i.e. most relevant and strongest in amplitude) for prospects with big losses. Our quantitative analysis of the experimental results supports the existence of an intrinsic limit of predictability, which is associated with the inherent probabilistic nature of choice. The results of the paper can find applications both in the prediction of choice of human decision makers as well as for organizing the operation of artificial intelligence.",,3,,,,,,,T Kovalenko and S Vincent and V I Yukalov and D Sornette,10.1088/2632-072X/acbd7e,2632-072X,1,JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-COMPLEXITY,,,,,WOS:000941054800001,,4,,2023,,
ID-278,article,Defending humankind: Anthropocentric bias in the appreciation of AI art,"We argue that recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI) in the domain of art (e.g., music, painting) pose a profound ontological threat to anthropocentric worldviews because they challenge one of the last frontiers of the human uniqueness narrative: artistic creativity. Four experiments (N = 1708), including a high-powered pre-registered experiment, consistently reveal a pervasive bias against AI-made artworks and shed light on its psy-chological underpinnings. The same artwork is preferred less when labeled as AI-made (vs. human-made) because it is perceived as less creative and subsequently induces less awe, an emotional response typically associated with the aesthetic appreciation of art. These effects are more pronounced among people with stronger anthropocentric creativity beliefs (i.e., who believe that creativity is a uniquely human characteristic). Sys-tematic depreciation of AI-made art (assignment of lower creative value, suppression of emotional reactions) appears to serve a shaken anthropocentric worldview whereby creativity is exclusively reserved for humans.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563223000584?via%3Dihub,1,1,1,artwork,,,,K Millet and F Buehler and G Z Du and M D Kokkoris,doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2023.107707,0747-5632,,COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR,,,,,WOS:001009394200001,,143,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563223000584?via%3Dihub,2023,,

The study adopted a positivist research paradigm by examining 249 samples of data collected during COVID-19 in China. The results indicate that patients with higher speciesism tend to have lower acceptance of medical AI in an independent role but higher acceptance in an assistive role.

ID-280,article,Analysis of Attitudes towards Food Waste in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Using Fuzzy Logic,"Attitudes and feelings towards food waste and positions on management policies have been vastly increased over the past few decades. Most of the available research on the analysis of attitudes towards food waste have been carried out using conventional statistical methods. This paper aims to assess and analyse attitudes and preferences of young Saudi females towards a number of policies and plans that are designed to meeting sustainable targets, using fuzzy logic analysis. This is a very important aim, especially since Vision 2030 in Saudi Arabia puts a major emphasis on sustainability, setting many resources to tackle environmental problems and achieving better social standards. The Methodology includes designing and collecting data from 199 participants using a questionnaire that includes 23 questions. Data were obtained from students at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University (PNU). The analysis includes utilising artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Fuzzy logic analysis has been widely used in many fields, but has not seen many applications on food waste analysis and attitudes. Fuzzy logic analysis has the advantage of producing efficient results from smaller sample sizes and, in particular, with qualitative characteristics of the used indicators. The participants expressed positive preferences and attitudes towards the programs and policies that are designed to achieve sustainability and manage food waste. The results show that over 25% of them prefer the option of ""storage for reuse"" of food waste, over 35% prefer the option of distribute it to needed families and over 30% opted to the option of recycling to fertilisers. The study also reveals a very good level of awareness and appreciation of food waste and plans associated with it. The implications from this study suggest that despite the positive attitudes, there still is more research needed to obtain full understanding of attitudes towards food waste from the whole range of the population in order to gain knowledge and build specific programs to reduce food waste and achieve sustainability in the country.",,3,,,,,,,A Malibari and G Alsawah and W Saleh and M M A Lashin,10.3390/su15043668,2071-1050,4,SUSTAINABILITY,,,,,WOS:000942024200001,,15,,2023,,
ID-281,article,"""Facilitators"" vs ""substitutes"": the influence of artificial intelligence products' image on consumer evaluation","PurposeThe rapid innovation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology promotes the prosperity of the AI product market. However, consumers seem to have negative attitudes (e.g. prejudice, aversion) toward AI products and services. Those negative attitudes are rooted in the fear that AI might replace humans. The authors thus propose that turning the image of AI from substitutes to facilitators can alleviate identity threat perception. This paper aims to examine how the image of AI products (facilitators vs substitutes) influences consumer evaluation and explores the underlying mechanism and boundary conditions. Design/methodology/approachThis study uses four experiments with between-subjects designs to investigate whether the image of AI products (facilitators vs substitutes) will affect consumer evaluation in specific consumption and service scenarios. The same products (or services) were manipulated as ""substitute"" or ""facilitator"" through advertisement slogans. Participants were randomly assigned to a condition and read the advertisement, then they reported their evaluation. The mediator perceived identity threat and the moderator preconceived perceptions of AI risks were measured by scales. The moderator, self-affirmation, was manipulated through the instruction of the experiment. FindingsThis study demonstrates that consumers give higher evaluation of AI products in the image of the facilitator than in the image of the substitute (Study 1). The underlying mechanism is that the perceived identity threat caused by ""facilitator"" products is lower than ""substitute"" products (Study 2). The effect of AI image is moderated by consumers' preconceived perceptions of AI risks (Study 3) and self-affirmation (Study 4). Specifically, for consumers who have a strong AI risk-perception, this effect exists, but it disappears for consumers who have a weak AI risk perception. When consumers are given a strong self-affirmation, the negative impact of the ""substitute"" image disappears. Originality/valueThis paper analyzes the psychological root of consumers' negative evaluation of AI technology from the perspective of AI's image. The proposed typology of ""substitutes"" and ""facilitators"" helps expand the vision on brand/product image and enriches the research on consumer self-identity in today's highly informatized market. The findings shed light on how to choose appropriate image for AI products, which will be crucial for increasing consumers' acceptance of AI products.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/2786742343/fulltextPDF/D0E66EF310B74CC4PQ/1?accountid=14026&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals,3,,,,,,"no comparison to humans per se, but similar to the study on framing of AI as augmenting vs. substituting",X Wang and H Zhu and D Jiang and S A Xia and C Q Xiao,doi.org/10.1108/NBRI-05-2022-0051,2040-8749,1,NANKAI BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL,,,,177-193,WOS:000911559000001,,14,,2023,,

ID-283,article,Human-Centric Contingency Analysis Metrics for Evaluating Operator Performance and Trust,"A novel set of system-state and control-action penalty functions are introduced as an alternative to traditional performance index contingency ranking. The novel system state penalty metrics are formulated based on piecewise linear functions of the system voltage and branch flow, guided by Weber's Law of human cognition. Novel continuous and discrete control action metrics are also developed to measure the inherent cost and risk associated with every action taken by human power system operator to resolve violations on a pre-contingent basis. These new metrics are combined with traditional human factors indices for measuring human-machine trust and cognitive workload to create a systematic framework for measuring and evaluating operator trust and reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for control room use. An existing AI-based contingency analysis recommender tool using a semi-supervised action algorithm is selected for a series of experiments with operations engineering staff using the IEEE 118 Bus System. The penalty metrics presented are demonstrated for both steady-state contingency analysis and transient stability studies, with the operations participants able to reduce the total system penalty in 85% of scenarios through remedial actions. A human-machine team was able to achieve equal or lower continuous control action penalty scores than the participant without availability of the recommender in 57% of experiment scenarios and lower continuous control action penalty scores than the AI tool alone in 83% of scenarios.",,3,,,,,,,A A Anderson and B A Jefferson and S Kincic and J E Wenskovitch and C K Fallon and J A Baweja and Y S Chen,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3322133,2169-3536,,IEEE ACCESS,,,,109689-109707,WOS:001086435300001,,11,,2023,,

In It ' s crucial to examine human responses alongside artificial intelligence in the healthcare field following an event and to create a collaborative geographic system based on modern technology. The ultimate goal is the restoration of countries ' essential services prioritizing health. In this research, spatial questions were conducted by considering public opinion, stakeholders, and decision makers under varying mental and emotional conditions. additionally, two different statistical and ranking methods were employed to comprehend the intricacies of individuals' mental states in a mathematical environment. All these methods were executed using software designed for locationbased decision making under equal conditions. This paper focuses on a specific region, as an example applicable to a country or even to a larger scale. The results showed that time factors are completely related to decision criteria. While emerging technologies are promising, complete reliance on artificial intelligence for decision-making is misguided. Human choices are intrinsic to decision-making, and therefore, all relevant criteria for spatial decision-making have been considered. This pioneering study, conducted for the first time, showed that human choices can be optimal in different situations with similar conditions. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence only makes logical decisions that are not compatible with human thinking. The ongoing research holds potential value for neurologists or mental health specialists emphasizing the significance of geographical sciences in urban development. While it ' s conceivable that medical issues and events can be addressed with artificial intelligence it appears that at least for the next few decades, even with the advancement of artificial intelligence, human presence remains essential in healthcare decision-making.",,3,,,,,,,M Fallah and T Karami and M K Kojouri,,0326-1735,,BOLETIN GEOGRAFICO,,,,,WOS:001168224500007,,45,,2023,,

Fairness problems in automatic interview assessment systems, especially video-based automated interview assessments, have less been addressed despite their prevalence in the recruiting field. In this paper, we propose a method that resolves fairness problems in an automated interview assessment system that uses multimodal data as input. This is mainly done by minimizing the Wasserstein distance between two sensitive groups by introducing a regularization term. Subsequently, we employ a hyperparameter that can control the trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

ID-288,article,LEGAL STATUS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FROM QUANTUM-THEORETIC PERSPECTIVE,"Massive inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) in the technosphere and electronic governments urges an update in legal regulation of these and related areas. The issue converges on the key question of whether AI can be endowed with legal personhood and capacity. Opposing views in this respect build on hardly compatible ethics and largely outdated scientific grounds with a clear perspective for deep cultural antagonisms and further fragmentation of the world. We contribute to this debate from the perspective of quantum cognitive science and show how it can resolve some of the current impasses. Our approach builds on the quantum-theoretic refinement of the concept of uncertainty into quantum and classical types: classical uncertainty denotes subjective ignorance of the present state of affairs, while quantum uncertainty accounts for individual freedom to construct the future. We show that legal capacity of intelligence, at bottom, is defined by the type of uncertainty it is capable to resolve. Natural intelligence, in particular, can resolve quantum uncertainties, generating genuine novelty and affective experience in the process. Classical AI, in contrast, is limited to algorithmic computation, bound to produce predefined results regardless of its complexity. Concepts of decision-making, subjectness, creativity, and personal meaning then are recognized as physically inapplicable to such systems. The proposed definitions of these terms complement and sharpen the criteria of legal capacity in the existing legislations, indicating that ""autonomy"" is essentially equivalent to ""appreciation."" Classical AI then appears as fundamentally alien to subjectness and legal capacity both in civil and common laws, resolving a delicate contradiction between them. Quantum-empowered AI, in contrast, escapes this conclusion due to its access to quantum uncertainty, introducing novel challenges with respect to responsibility gaps and meaningful human control. The developed approach aligns with the present legal practice and ethical discourse, contributing to the scientifically informed development of law in technological societies.",,3,,,,,,,E Melnikova and I Surov,10.21684/2412-2343-2023-10-4-5-34,2409-9058,4,BRICS LAW JOURNAL,,,,5-34,WOS:001126525800007,,10,,2023,,

Therefore, this study investigates ways to alter applicant reactions to AI-supported selection. Using a scenario-based between-subject design with participants from the working population (N = 200), we varied the information provided by the organization about the reasons for using an AI-supported selection process (no additional information vs. written information vs. video information) in comparison to a human selection process. Results show that the use of AI without information and with written information decreased perceived fairness, personableness perception, and increased emotional creepiness. In turn, perceived fairness, personableness perceptions, and emotional creepiness mediated the association between an AI-supported selection process, organizational attractiveness, and the intention to further proceed with the selection process. Moreover, results did not differ for applicants who were provided video explanations of the benefits of AI-supported selection tools and those who participated in an actual human selection process.

In response, government authorities plan to implement a wide range of AI-driven healthcare solutions. These include care robots that assist the physically handicapped or elderly, chatbots that provide anonymous online mental health consultation, and diagnostic software utilizing machine learning. Yet one of the most popular smart technologies to augment the nation's already overstrained and undermanned healthcare system is a little known but emerging emotional AI technologies, i.e., deep learning systems trained to read, classify, and respond to human emotions. These technologies are being sold on a commercial level not only to the public but also to rehabilitation centers, local hospitals, and senior citizen residences. Although the augmentation of healthcare services to intelligent machines may seem like a logical step in a country well-known for its long-standing affection toward robots, Japanese society is also known for its adherence to established social relations and traditional institutional practices, especially, in the realm of medical care. In order to gauge Japanese acceptance of emotion-sensing technology, we analyze a dataset of 245 visitors to clinics and hospitals in a typical suburban area in Japan using multiple linear regression. The results show that in general, senior and male patients perceive the emotional AI technology more negatively. For behavioral variables, patients' level of familiarity has positive correlations with attitudes toward emotional AI-based applications in private setting ( ss Familiarity_AttitudePri=0.346, p<0.001) and public setting ( ss Familiarity_PublicAttitude=0.297, p<0.001); while concern for losing control to AI has negative correlations with the attitudes' variables: private setting ( ss LosingControl_AttitudePri= 0.262,p=0.002) and public setting ( ss LosingControl_AttitudePub=-0.188, p=0.044). Interestingly, concerns over violation of privacy and discrimination are non-significant correlates, which contradict the emerging literature on this subject.

It is important to know how people react to such AI-driven negative consequences and subsequently evaluate the fairness of AI's decisions. This study theorizes and empirically tests two psychological mechanisms that explain the process: (a) heuristic expectations of AI's consistent performance (automation bias) and subsequent frustration of unfulfilled expectations (algorithmic aversion) and (b) heuristic perceptions of AI's controllability over negative results. Our findings from two experimental studies reveal that these two mechanisms work in an opposite direction. First, participants tend to display more sensitive responses to AI's inconsistent performance and thus make more punitive assessments of AI's decision fairness, when compared to responses to human experts. Second, as participants perceive AI has less control over unfavorable outcomes than human experts, they are more tolerant in their assessments of AI.",,1,1,1,,,,,S M Jones-Jang and Y J Park,10.1093/jcmc/zmac029,1083-6101,1,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION,,,,,WOS:000885646100001,,28,,2022,,

As a consequence, acceptance by end-users remains somewhat hesitant. While lacking transparency has been said to hinder trust and enforce aversion towards these systems, studies that connect user trust to transparency and subsequently acceptance are scarce. In response, our research is concerned with the development of a theoretical model that explains end-user acceptance of intelligent systems. We utilize the unified theory of acceptance and use in information technology as well as explanation theory and related theories on initial trust and user trust in information systems.

A total of 368 participants were randomly and evenly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions, one depicting low-uncertainty investment recom-mendation involving blue-chip stocks while the other depicting high-uncertainty investment recommendation involving penny stocks. Results show that attitude toward AI was positively associated with behavioral intention to accept AI-based recommendations, trust in AI, and perceived accuracy of AI. Furthermore, uncertainty level moderated how attitude, trust and perceived accuracy varied with behavioral intention to accept AI-based recommendations. When uncertainty was low, a favorable attitude toward AI seemed sufficient to promote reliance on automation. However, when uncertainty was high, a favorable attitude toward AI was a necessary but no longer sufficient condition for AI acceptance.

The emotions expressed by music such as joy, anger, and sadness are the meaning of music's existence. Music without emotion will be dead. However, the music itself has no emotion at all; it is just a regular sound, so the emotional reading of music performance is very important. Music performance is an interpretation of music, and it is the most important emotional information and communication medium for human beings. Through the appreciation of the works to express the author's emotions, the different performance forms of musical instruments, dance, and singing bring emotional resonance to the audience. Edge computing is the core technology and edge node of the Internet of everything in the new era, and it is constantly innovating with the rapid development of computers and the great changes brought about by them. Nowadays, people's demand for emotional information processing of music performances has also increased. The research attention to music performance and the attention to its application technology have also received unprecedented development, so the requirements for the ability of human and machine interaction are getting higher and higher. With the increasing maturity of multimedia and communication technologies, there is an increasing expectation of using computers to express human thoughts and emotions. By combining the two, Dongfeng's expression and analysis of music emotions through edge computing have also ushered in new developments.

AI art is a special form, existing between natural beauty and human art: AI art, first of all, is not a natural aesthetic object, given that it is the product of artefacts. Its appreciation is mixed with interests, and its artistic generation is a kind of ""purposeful non-purposefulness."" Secondly, AI art is not equal to traditional human art, because AI has no intentionality or consciousness. Thirdly, AI participates in the construction of artistic logic and breaks the boundary of traditional art. AI can be regarded as an ""agent"" in art generation, and together with people constitute the ""actor network"" of art. The processes of generation, identification and appreciation of AI art include the judgment of true and false.

ID-301,article,An artificial intelligence (AI)-readiness and adoption framework for AgriTech firms,"With recent technological advancements, empowered by the self-learning capabilities of algorithms and increasing power of machine computation, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies have become more salient for addressing and solving specific types of business problems. This saliency is no less important for firms operating in the agricultural technology (AgriTech) sector, where the impacts of AI-driven technologies and systems create new opportunities and challenges. We argue that with the unique characteristics of AI technologies and emerging challenges and aspirations of the AgriTech sector, there is a need to rethink traditional theories of technology adoption and readiness within AgriTech firms. In this paper, we develop an understanding of AI readiness and adoption through a fuller appreciation of micro- and meso-empirical data that delineates the determinants of AI readiness and uncovers a set of strategic components that can help AgriTech firms better manage the readiness process for AI adoption. To do this, we employ a mixed-methods approach and elicit data from 236 e-surveys and 25 interviews from an important conference in the AgriTech field.

Study 1 reports confirmatory validation of the General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) following initial validation elsewhere. Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed the two-factor structure (Positive, Negative) and showed good convergent and divergent validity with a related scale. Study 2 tested whether psychological factors (Big Five personality traits, corporate distrust, and general trust) predicted attitudes towards AI. Introverts had more positive attitudes towards AI overall, likely because of algorithm appreciation. Conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with forgiving attitudes towards negative aspects of AI. Higher corporate distrust led to negative attitudes towards AI overall, while higher general trust led to positive views of the benefits of AI.

However, technology is radically changing how public administration is organised and reliance on Artificial Intelligence is on the rise across all sectors. While carrying the promise of an increasingly efficient administration, automating (parts of) administrative decision-making processes also poses a challenge to our human-centred systems of control of public power. This article focuses on one of these control mechanisms: the duty to give reasons under EU law, a pillar of administrative law designed to enable individuals to challenge decisions and courts to exercise their powers of review. First, it analyses whether the duty to give reasons can be meaningfully applied when EU bodies rely on AI systems to inform their decision-making. Secondly, it examines the added value of secondary law, in particular the data protection rules applicable to EU institutions and the draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act, in complementing and adapting the duty to give reasons to better fulfil its purpose in a (partially) automated administration. This article concludes that the duty to give reasons provides a useful starting point but leaves a number of aspects unclear.

Design/methodology/approach An experimental approach has been adopted with three studies, all featuring a between-subjects design. Findings Through three studies, the findings document that, in a financial decision-making context, anthropomorphizing AI leads to significantly greater risk aversion in investment decision-making (Study 1). This occurs because AI-enabled chatbot anthropomorphization activates greater psychological risk attachment, which enacts consumers to manifest stronger risk aversion tendency (Studies 2 and 3).

Intelligent manufacturing increases the demand for vision methods in production scenes. However, the diversity and increment of the targets, and the feature robustness and scheme migration have restricted further implementation of this technology. To address this problem, this study establishes a robust inspection system, including type insensitive target ontology rough localization, component-based model reverse incremental recognition, and geometric attribute extraction, based on the joint strategy of lightweight neural network recommendation and knowledge guidance. Domain common sense and artificial knowledge are integrated into the whole method, of which the reasonable structural design alleviates the limitation of reliance on artificial intelligence or traditional image processing alone.

ID-307,article,Perceived Benefits of Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the AEC Sector: An Interpretive Structural Modeling Approach,"Increasing demand for infrastructure amidst the surge in the urbanization of cities and newly emerging commercial nerves has spurred the need to reinvent and rethink traditional approaches for delivering infrastructure. This has been identified as even more critical given the global drive and discourse on the sustainability of the construction sector and its health and safety performance. Given the potential gains of adopting construction automation and AI in infrastructure delivery, stakeholders' convincing appreciation of its benefit is vital to its widespread adoption in the AEC sector. This explored and evaluated the critical benefits of integrating automation in construction processes in the architectural, engineering, and construction sector and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in driving its systems and workflows. The study adopts an interpretive structural modeling approach based on interviews of construction stakeholders in diverse countries to develop a hierarchical model of the interrelationships of the benefits. Furthermore, the Matrice d'Impacts croises-multiplication applique a classement analysis (MICMAC) was used to categorize the benefits. Highlighted perceived benefits such as improved project quality, simplification of construction tasks, workflow improvements, and safety performance, amongst others, were fractionalized into levels.

ID-308,article,AI Ekphrasis: Multi-Modal Learning with Foundation Models for Fine-Grained Poetry Retrieval,"Artificial intelligence research in natural language processing in the context of poetry struggles with the recognition of holistic content such as poetic symbolism, metaphor, and other fine-grained attributes. Given these challenges, multi-modal image-poetry reasoning and retrieval remain largely unexplored. Our recent accessibility study indicates that poetry is an effective medium to convey visual artwork attributes for improved artwork appreciation of people with visual impairments. We, therefore, introduce a deep learning approach for the automatic retrieval of poetry suitable to the input images. The recent state-of-the-art CLIP provides a way for multi-modal visual and text features matched using cosine similarity. However, it lacks shared cross-modality attention features to model fine-grained relationships. The proposed approach in this work takes advantage of strong pre-training of the CLIP model and overcomes its limitations by introducing shared attention parameters to better model the fine-grained relationship between both modalities. We test and compare our proposed approach using the expertly annotated MiltiM-Poem dataset, which is considered the largest public image-poetry pair dataset for English poetry. The proposed approach aims to solve the problems of image-based attribute recognition and automatic retrieval for fine-grained poetic verses. The test results reflect that the shared attention parameters alleviate fine-grained attribute recognition, and the proposed approach is a significant step towards automatic multi-modal retrieval for improved artwork appreciation of people with visual impairments.",,3,,,,,,,M S Jabbar and J Shin and J D Cho,10.3390/electronics11081275,2079-9292,8,ELECTRONICS,,,,,WOS:000786194500001,,11,,2022,,

Two sets of paintings were compared by 380 participants, 70 percent of whom had previous painting experience. Results indicate that color and line are the key elements of aesthetic appreciation. Additionally, the style transfer had a marked effect on the viewer when there was a close correspondence between the painting and the style transfer but not when there was little correspondence, indicating that AI is of limited effectiveness in modifying an existing style.

ID-311,article,The effects of domain knowledge on trust in explainable AI and task performance: A case of peer-to-peer lending,"Increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to assist complex decision-making such as financial investing. However, there are concerns regarding the black-box nature of AI algorithms. The field of explainable AI (XAI) has emerged to address these concerns. XAI techniques can reveal how an AI decision is formed and can be used to understand and appropriately trust an AI system. However, XAI techniques still may not be human centred and may not support human decision-making adequately. In this work, we explored how domain knowledge, identified by expert decision makers, can be used to achieve a more human-centred approach to AI. We measured the effect of domain knowledge on trust in AI, reliance on AI, and task performance in an AI assisted complex decision-making environment. In a peer-to-peer lending simulator, non-expert participants made financial investments using an AI assistant. The presence or absence of domain knowledge was manipulated. The results showed that participants who had access to domain knowledge relied less on the AI assistant when the AI assistant was incorrect and indicated less trust in AI assistant. However, overall investing performance was not affected.

ID-313,article,Using systems thinking methodologies to address health care complexities and evidence implementation,"Background: Despite health care advances, artificial intelligence and government interventions aiming to improve the health and wellbeing of citizens, huge disparities and failures in care provision exist. This is demonstrated by the rising number of medical errors, increase in readmission rates and mortality rates, and the failure of many health systems to successfully cope with events, such as pandemics and natural disasters. This shortfall is in part because of the complexity of the health care system, the interconnectedness of various parts of service, funding models, the complexity of patients' conditions, patient and carer needs, and the clinical processes needed for patients via multiple providers. Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe the use of system thinking methodologies to address complex problems such as those in the public health and health services domains. Method: A description of the system thinking methodology and its associated methods including causal loop diagrams, social network analysis and soft system methodology are described with examples in the health care setting. Results: There are various models of knowledge translation that have been employed including the Joanna Briggs Institute model of implementation of evidence into practice, the triple C, and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services. However, many of these models are neither scalable nor sustainable, and are most effective for localized projects implemented by trained clinicians and champions in relevant settings. System thinking is essentially a modelling process, which aims to create opportunities for change via an appreciation of perspective, and recognition that complex problems are a result of interconnected factors. The article argues that systems thinking applications need to move beyond that of addressing complex health issues pertaining to a population, and rather consider complex problems surrounding the delivery of high-quality health care.

The impact of 21st-century technological progress on employment has only just begun to make itself felt and it will take time to realize its full extent. However, the main innovation is already common knowledge: robots (and artificial intelligence) are finding their way into the production process. According to several recent (although controversial) contributions, the phenomenon is radically different from past technological revolutions and could generate high levels of unemployment, calling for innovative redistributive public policies. The present article, building on Keynes' (1930) short essay (""Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren"") and referring to some of the principles and models of behavioral and happiness economics, focuses on the best-known of these policies, namely provision of an unconditional basic income. A series of factors - loss aversion and hedonic adaptation, the impossibility of escalating to higher-grade consumption behaviors, social interaction in the form of active and passive envy, loss of self-esteem and social stigma - are all likely to have a negative impact on well-being if an unconditional basic income that remains unchanging over time is implemented.

Under this background, more and more enterprise respond to the call of the SASAC; in order to achieve the goals of corporate financial cost savings and financial management efficiency improved, we began to provide services through financial sharing. The research of information fusion theory involves many basic theories, which can be roughly divided into two large categories from the algorithmic point of view: probabilistic statistical method and artificial intelligence method. The main task of artificial intelligence is to realize the computer for some learning, thinking process, and wisdom formation of simulation, and an important goal of information integration is the human brain comprehensive processing ability simulation, so artificial intelligence method will have broad application prospects in the field of information fusion; the common methods have D-S evidence reasoning, fuzzy theory, neural network, genetic algorithm, rough set, and other information fusion methods. The purpose of this paper is to proceed from the internal financial situation of the enterprise, analyze data security issues in the operation of financial shared services, and find a breakthrough in solving problems. But, with constantly expanding of enterprise group financial sharing service scale, the urgent problem to be solved is how to ensure the financial sharing services provided by enterprises in the cloud computing environment. This paper combines financial sharing service theory and information security theory and provides reference for building financial sharing information security for similar enterprises. For some enterprise that have not established a financial shared service center yet, they can learn from the establishment of the financial sharing information security system in this paper and provide a reference for enterprise to avoid the same types of risks and problems. For enterprise that has established and has begun to practice a financial shared information security system, appropriate risk aversion measures combined with actual situation of the enterprise with four dimensions related to information security system optimization was formulated and described in this paper. In summary, in the background of cloud computing, financial sharing services have highly simplified operational applications, and data storage capabilities and computational analysis capabilities have been improved greatly.

ID-321,article,Acceptance of Medical Treatment Regimens Provided by AI vs. Human,"Along with the increasing development of information technology, the interaction between artificial intelligence and humans is becoming even more frequent. In this context, a phenomenon called ""medical AI aversion"" has emerged, in which the same behaviors of medical AI and humans elicited different responses. Medical AI aversion can be understood in terms of the way that people attribute mind capacities to different targets. It has been demonstrated that when medical professionals dehumanize patients-making fewer mental attributions to patients and, to some extent, not perceiving and treating them as full human-it leads to more painful and effective treatment options. From the patient's perspective, will painful treatment options be unacceptable when they perceive the doctor as a human but disregard his or her own mental abilities? Is it possible to accept a painful treatment plan because the doctor is artificial intelligence? Based on the above, the current study investigated the above questions and the phenomenon of medical AI aversion in a medical context. Through three experiments it was found that: (1) human doctor was accepted more when patients were faced with the same treatment plan; (2) there was an interactional effect between the treatment subject and the nature of the treatment plan, and, therefore, affected the acceptance of the treatment plan; and (3) experience capacities mediated the relationship between treatment provider (AI vs. human) and treatment plan acceptance. Overall, this study attempted to explain the phenomenon of medical AI aversion from the mind perception theory and the findings are revealing at the applied level for guiding the more rational use of AI and how to persuade patients.",,1,1,1,"medical, healthcare",,,"AI algorithms lack the enthusiasm and responsibility that many patients see as necessary for a medical advisor.

ID-322,article,Conflict resolution in the era of cognitive multicriteria decision-making: an AHP-retributive approach,"This paper puts forth the foundation for a different type of negotiation that reflects in a more realistic way the behavior of human beings when making complex decisions, aligned with the cognitive process involved. The positive and the negative aspects of decisions reflect two components in the human brain: the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala. The first component deals with behavior related to rewards or potential gains, and the other with behavior related to risk aversion or potential losses. Negotiations require communication, learning, accommodation of positions, and development of alternatives and modification of constraints. Negotiation support systems help and advice negotiators; structure and analyze the problem; elicit preferences to construct a preference function; visualize different aspects of the problem and the process; and facilitate communication and learning. The methodology used is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process previously employed in a retributive conflict in which each party calculates the incremental benefits it gets and the costs to its opponent. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is used to show the viability of the approach and the type of inputs we need to study conflicts with this approach. The negotiation platform that we describe here help the actors to start and engage a negotiation from noncooperative parties. It can also be used in human- negotiations to expedite reaching an agreement if one exists. However, we are not seeking automated negotiations. Advantages and risks of Artificial Intelligence contribution in negotiation support systems for cognitive and retributive conflict resolution based on AHP (CRCR-AHP) are also discussed.",,3,,,,,,,L G Vargas and C Moreno-Loscertales and J M Moreno-Jiménez,10.1111/itor.13088,0969-6016,3,INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS IN OPERATIONAL RESEARCH,,,,1453-1478,WOS:000722748100001,,30,,2023,,
ID-323,article,"Discovering gastronomic tourists' profiles through artificial neural networks: analysis, opinions and attitudes","As the importance given by tourists to the different aspects of gastronomic tourism depends on their profiles, this research aims to determine the relationship between the social characteristics of these culinary tourists (such as gender, age, income, and educational level) and the relevance attributed by them to several opinions and attitudes related to gastronomic tourism. This research is based on field work through surveys filled in by culinary tourists with questions about perceptions and thoughts regarding gastronomic tourism both in general and in the particular case of Cordoba, a World Heritage Site in Southern Spain. Using artificial intelligence techniques as the Multilayer Perceptron, an artificial neural network is developed to estimate a 'tourist profile' based on inputs which are the pre-determined replies to the questionnaire. This technique is rarely used in surveys, especially in tourism sector. The model developed can assess the variations produced along the item valuation in every characteristic of the tourist profile. Thus, an increase in age implies more appreciation for dishes variety, its tasting at destination and willingness to return. Findings presented can be useful for professionals and entrepreneurs dedicated to culinary experiences and for public institutions which aim to promote gastronomic tourism at destination.",,3,,,,,,,S Moral-Cuadra and M A Solano-Sánchez and A Menor-Campos and T López-Guzman,10.1080/02508281.2021.2002630,0250-8281,3,TOURISM RECREATION RESEARCH,,,,347-358,WOS:000722545100001,,47,,2022,,
ID-324,article,Drivers and social implications of Artificial Intelligence adoption in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact people worldwide-steadily depleting scarce resources in healthcare. Medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a much-needed relief but only if the technology gets adopted at scale. The present research investigates people's intention to adopt medical AI as well as the drivers of this adoption in a representative study of two European countries (Denmark and France, N = 1068) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results reveal AI aversion; only 1 of 10 individuals choose medical AI over human physicians in a hypothetical triage-phase of COVID-19 pre-hospital entrance. Key predictors of medical AI adoption are people's trust in medical AI and, to a lesser extent, the trait of open-mindedness. More importantly, our results reveal that mistrust and perceived uniqueness neglect from human physicians, as well as a lack of social belonging significantly increase people's medical AI adoption. These results suggest that for medical AI to be widely adopted, people may need to express less confidence in human physicians and to even feel disconnected from humanity. We discuss the social implications of these findings and propose that successful medical AI adoption policy should focus on trust building measures-without eroding trust in human physicians.",,1,1,1,"medical, healthcare",,,"self-report questions, perceived trust and uniqueness of AI/human doctor",D A Frank and C T Elbæk and C K Borsting and P Mitkidis and T Otterbring and S Borau,doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259928,1932-6203,11,PLOS ONE,,,,,WOS:000755579000017,,16,,2021,,

This study uncovers how enhanced (IFN alpha)/JAK-STAT signaling directly influences estrogen receptor (ER alpha) activation in the absence of estrogen. We found that inhibiting IFN alpha signaling downregulates expression and activation of ER alpha. In addition, STAT1 and ER alpha directly interact and regulate a key interferon-stimulated gene, IFITM1, in AI-resistant breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that crosstalk occurs between IFN alpha and ER alpha pathways, which contributes to aggression and survival of AI-resistant breast cancer, thus representing a novel mechanism of acquired AI resistance.",,3,,,,,,,T E Escher and P Dandawate and A Sayed and C R Hagan and S Anant and J Lewis-Wambi,10.3390/cancers13205130,2072-6694,20,CANCERS,,,,,WOS:000714907300001,,13,,2021,,

However, educational offerings tailored to the need of medical professionals are scarce. To fill this gap, we created the course ""AI for Doctors: Medical Imaging "". An analysis of participants' opinions on AI and self-perceived skills rated on a five-point Likert scale was conducted before and after the course. The participants' attitude towards AI in medical imaging was very optimistic before and after the course. However, deeper knowledge of AI and the process for validating and deploying it resulted in significantly less overoptimism with respect to perceivable patient benefits through AI (p = 0.020). Self-assessed skill ratings significantly improved after the course, and the appreciation of the course content was very positive. However, we observed a substantial drop-out rate, mostly attributed to the lack of time of medical professionals. There is a high demand for educational offerings regarding AI in medical imaging among medical professionals, and better education may lead to a more realistic appreciation of clinical adoption.

ID-327,article,Evaluating the prospects for university-based ethical governance in artificial intelligence and data-driven innovation,"There has been considerable debate around the ethical issues raised by data-driven technologies such as artificial intelligence. Ethical principles for the field have focused on the need to ensure that such technologies are used for good rather than harm, that they enshrine principles of social justice and fairness, that they protect privacy, respect human autonomy and are open to scrutiny. While development of such principles is well advanced, there is as yet little consensus on the mechanisms appropriate for ethical governance in this field. This paper examines the prospects for the university ethics committee to undertake effective review of research conducted on data-driven technologies in the university context. Challenges identified include: the relatively narrow focus of university-based ethical review on the human subjects research process and lack of capacity to anticipate downstream impacts; the difficulties of accommodating the complex interplay of academic and commercial interests in the field; and the need to ensure appropriate expertise from both specialists and lay voices. Overall, the challenges identified sharpen appreciation of the need to encourage a joined-up and effective system of ethical governance that fosters an ethical culture rather than replacing ethical reflection with bureaucracy.",,3,,,,,,,C Hine,10.1177/17470161211022790,1747-0161,4,RESEARCH ETHICS,,,,464-479,WOS:000904311400005,,17,,2021,,
ID-328,article,Impact of Heterogeneity and Risk Aversion on Task Allocation in Multi-Agent Teams,"Cooperative multi-agent decision-making is a ubiquitous problem with many real-world applications. In many practical applications, it is desirable to design a multi-agent team with a heterogeneous composition where the agents can have different capabilities and levels of risk tolerance to address diverse requirements. While heterogeneity in multi-agent teams offers benefits, new challenges arise including how to find optimal heterogeneous team compositions and how to dynamically distribute tasks among agents in complex operations. In this work, we develop an artificial intelligence framework for multi-agent heterogeneous teams to dynamically learn task distributions among agents through reinforcement learning. The framework extends Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDP) to be compatible to model various types of heterogeneity. We demonstrate our approach with a benchmark problem on a disaster relief scenario. The effect of heterogeneity and risk aversion in agent capabilities and decision-making strategies on the performance of multi-agent teams in uncertain environments is analyzed. Results show that a well-designed heterogeneous team outperforms its homogeneous counterpart and possesses higher adaptivity in uncertain environments.",,3,,,,,,,H C Wu and A Ghadami and A E Bayrak and J M Smereka and B I Epureanu,10.1109/LRA.2021.3097259,2377-3766,4,IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS,,,,7065-7072,WOS:000678343900050,,6,,2021,,
ID-329,article,Theorizing artificial intelligence acceptance and digital entrepreneurship model,"Purpose This paper aims to determine the entrepreneur's intention to accept artificial intelligence (AI) and provide advancement in the domain of digital entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach Extensive literature review and theories have been considered in the area of technology adoption/acceptance and digital entrepreneurship to identify the factors affecting the intention of entrepreneurs with respect to accept AI for digital entrepreneurship. Further, a model, artificial intelligence acceptance and digital entrepreneurship (AIADE) is theorized after formulating some hypotheses. The theorized model has been validated with 476 useable responses. Findings The findings revealed that performance expectancy, openness, social influence, hedonic motivations and generativity have a positive impact on entrepreneur's acceptance intention of AI. Additionally, affordance has no direct relationship with AI acceptance intention, but it affects AI acceptance intention through attitude. Inconvenience has a significant negative relationship with the intention to accept AI, while uncertainty was found to be positively affecting the AI acceptance intention. Effort expectancy did not confirm any significant relationship. Research limitations/implications By considering existing theoretical models and concepts the authors contribute to the AI's theoretical progress, specifically in the domain of entrepreneurship. The authors complement and extend existing technology adoption/acceptance theories and digital entrepreneurship theories by developing a theoretical model, AIADE, explaining the entrepreneur's intention to accept AI. Practical implications The practical implications of the study show that performance expectancy (positive), openness (positive), social influence (positive), hedonic motivations (positive), generativity (positive), affordance through attitude (positive), uncertainty (positive), effort expectancy (negative) and inconvenience (negative) are the antecedents for the entrepreneurs to accept AI for digital entrepreneurship. The authors suggest that intentional improvement planning is developed by increasing entrepreneur's positive perceptions of AI affordance and explanation of its generativity and openness, and improving their attitude of using AI for digital entrepreneurship. Originality/value This is the first study that reveals the critical antecedents of entrepreneur's intention to accept AI for digital entrepreneurship.

ID-330,article,Targeting Amino Acid Metabolic Reprogramming via L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 (LAT1) for Endocrine-Resistant Breast Cancer,"Simple Summary L-type amino acid transporters such as LAT1 and LAT3 are associated with the uptake of essential amino acids. In particular, LAT1 regulates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and cell proliferation by regulating leucine uptake. The purpose of this study is to clarify amino acid metabolism via LAT1 and LAT3 in breast cancer and the potential roles of LAT1 in the development of therapeutic resistance and clinical outcome of the patients. Results demonstrated that high LAT1 status was associated with tumor progression in breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NAH), and LAT1 expression in the estrogen deprivation-resistant (EDR) breast carcinoma cell lines were upregulated. JPH203, a selective LAT1 inhibitor, demonstrated inhibitory effects on cell proliferation in the EDR cells. Therefore, LAT1 could serve not only as a prognosis biomarker but also a therapeutic target in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has been well known to interact with the estrogen receptor (ER)-pathway and to be also frequently upregulated in aromatase inhibitor (AI)-resistant breast cancer patients. Intracellular levels of free amino acids, especially leucine, regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation. L-type amino acid transporters such as LAT1 and LAT3 are associated with the uptake of essential amino acids. LAT1 expression could mediate leucine uptake, mTORC1 signaling, and cell proliferation. Therefore, in this study, we explored amino acid metabolism, including LAT1, in breast cancer and clarified the potential roles of LAT1 in the development of therapeutic resistance and the eventual clinical outcome of the patients. We evaluated LAT1 and LAT3 expression before and after neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NAH) and examined LAT1 function and expression in estrogen deprivation-resistant (EDR) breast carcinoma cell lines. Tumors tended to be in advanced stages in the cases whose LAT1 expression was high. LAT1 expression in the EDR cell lines was upregulated. JPH203, a selective LAT1 inhibitor, demonstrated inhibitory effects on cell proliferation in EDR cells. Hormone therapy changed the tumor microenvironment and resulted in metabolic reprogramming through inducing LAT1 expression. LAT1 expression then mediated leucine uptake, enhanced mTORC1 signaling, and eventually resulted in AI resistance. Therefore, LAT1 could be the potential therapeutic target in AI-resistant breast cancer patients.",,3,,,,,,,H Shindo and N Harada-Shoji and A Ebata and M Sato and T Soga and M Miyashita and H Tada and M Kawai and S Kosaka and K Onuki and S Usami and S Furumoto and S Hayashi and T Abe and T Suzuki and T Ishida and H Sasano,10.3390/cancers13174375,2072-6694,17,CANCERS,,,,,WOS:000694235900001,,13,,2021,,

Therefore, an AI acceptance model based on established technology acceptance models was developed and tested in a sample of 218 psychology students. An acceptable fit with the data was found for an adapted version. Perceived usefulness and ease of use were most predictive for the students' attitude towards AI; attitude itself, as well as perceived usefulness, social norm, and perceived knowledge, were predictors for the intention to use AI.

For each of the clusters, we analyze the relationship between the skeptical opinion of consumers related to social media information and some present trends about the development of technologies and AI, the influence of celebrity trend setters and the need to check the received information. The results of the research show that the development of technologies and AI have an influence on the skeptical opinion related to media information for some consumer groups.

It also requires an appreciation of the factors shaping the resources deployed in their address. To this end, this article probes the extent to which policing demand (crime, anti-social behaviour, public safety and welfare) and deployment (front-line resource) are similarly conditioned by the social and physical urban environment, and by incident complexity. The prospect of exploring policing demand, deployment and their interplay is opened through the utilisation of big data and artificial intelligence and their integration with administrative and open data sources in a generalised method of moments (GMM) multilevel model. The research finds that policing demand and deployment hold varying and time-sensitive association with features of the urban environment. Moreover, we find that the complexities embedded in policing demands serve to shape both the cumulative and marginal resources expended in their address. Beyond their substantive policy relevance, these findings serve to open new avenues for urban criminological research centred on the consideration of the interplay between policing demand and deployment.",,3,,,,,,,M Ellison and J Bannister and W D Lee and M S Haleem,10.1177/0042098020981007,0042-0980,15,URBAN STUDIES,,,,3157-3175,WOS:000677404100001,,58,,2021,,
ID-336,article,Regulation of aromatase in cancer,"The regulation of aromatase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of estrogen in normal and cancer cells, has been associated with growth factor signaling and immune response modulation. The tissue-specific regulatory roles of these factors are of particular importance as local aromatase expression is strongly linked to cancer development/progression and disease outcomes in patients. Therefore, aromatase has become a chemotherapeutic target and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are used in the clinic for treating hormone-dependent cancers. Although AIs have shown promising results in the treatment of cancers, the emerging increase in AI-resistance necessitates the development of new and improved targeted therapies. This review discusses the role of tumor and stromal-derived growth factors and immune cell modulators in regulating aromatase.

ID-337,article,Use and Control of Artificial Intelligence in Patients Across the Medical Workflow: Single-Center Questionnaire Study of Patient Perspectives,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining increasing importance in many medical specialties, yet data on patients' opinions on the use of AI in medicine are scarce. Objective: This study aimed to investigate patients' opinions on the use of AI in different aspects of the medical workflow and the level of control and supervision under which they would deem the application of AI in medicine acceptable. Methods: Patients scheduled for computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging voluntarily participated in an anonymized questionnaire between February 10, 2020, and May 24, 2020. Patient information, confidence in physicians vs AI in different clinical tasks, opinions on the control of AI, preference in cases of disagreement between AI and physicians, and acceptance of the use of AI for diagnosing and treating diseases of different severity were recorded. Results: In total, 229 patients participated. Patients favored physicians over AI for all clinical tasks except for treatment planning based on current scientific evidence. In case of disagreement between physicians and AI regarding diagnosis and treatment planning, most patients preferred the physician's opinion to AI (96.2% [153/159] vs 3.8% [6/159] and 94.8% [146/154] vs 5.2% [8/154], respectively; P=.001). AI supervised by a physician was considered more acceptable than AI without physician supervision at diagnosis (confidence rating 3.90 [SD 1.20] vs 1.64 [SD 1.03], respectively; P=.001) and therapy (3.77 [SD 1.18] vs 1.57 [SD 0.96], respectively; P=.001).

ID-340,article,Customer Acceptance of Use of Artificial Intelligence in Hospitality Services: An Indian Hospitality Sector Perspective,"This research endeavour tested and validated the artificially intelligent device use acceptance (AIDUA) three-stage AI acceptance framework in the context of the Indian hospitality sector. For this purpose, data on the constructs that captured primary appraisal (i.e., social influence, hedonic motivation and anthropomorphism), secondary appraisal (i.e., performance and effort expectancy), emotion, willingness to use AI devices and objection to use AI devices were captured from 210 guests/customers from 14 luxury hotels spread across the union territory of New Delhi and the state of Chandigarh in India. Findings that emerge from this study validate the fact that customers do indeed go through three stages of decision-making process before they demonstrate their proclivity to use AI devices or exhibit objection to use AI devices. In particular, the study found that both performance and effort expectancy influenced customer emotion which, in its turn, exercised its effect on the construct of willingness to use AI devices and objection to use AI devices among hotel customers.

ID-341,article,NDE Perception and Emerging Reality: NDE 4.0 Value Extraction,"Up until recently, the industrial revolution was divided into three phases: (1) simple mechanization; (2) mass production; and (3) automation. Similarly, nondestructive evaluation (NDE) can be divided into three phases: (1) tools, such as lenses, sharpened the human senses; (2) the conversion of waves made the invisible visible by offering a ""look"" inside components; and (3) automation, digitization, and reconstruction enhanced the accuracy, speed, and ease of information sharing. During industrial development, although NDE has been decisively responsible for the quality of the manufactured goods and safety of operations, it has carried perceptions not commensurate with the value realized. Currently, industry leaders have been talking about a fourth revolution: the informatization, digitization, and networking of industrial production and the concurrent use of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and 5G networks. For NDE, this fourth revolution offers an unprecedented opportunity to address technical challenges and negative perceptions at the same time, leading to an enhanced appreciation of this significant discipline. The paper begins with a survey of professionals in the field to identify the perceptions surrounding NDE and moves on to demonstrate the value of integrating Industry 4.0 with NDE in the form of NDE 4.0 driven by connectivity and data mining. Building on that, this paper next presents the necessary basics and concepts, like semantic interoperability and the Industrial Internet of Things. Moreover, the key interfaces and data formats, like OPC UA and DIOCONDE, are discussed, and the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA), which goes one step further by ensuring data sovereignty, enabling data markets, and connecting the world, is introduced. The emerging reality of NDE 4.0 is that robust digital interfaces help create value, and statistical approaches combined with digital twins and threads help extract that value.",,3,,,,,,,J Vrana,10.32548/2020.me-04131,0025-5327,7,MATERIALS EVALUATION,,,,835-851,WOS:000565313900006,,78,,2020,,

ID-343,article,First Steps Towards an Ethics of Robots and Artificial Intelligence,"This article offers an overview of the main first-order ethical questions raised by robots and Artificial Intelligence (RAIs) under five broad rubrics: functionality, inherent significance, rights and responsibilities, side-effects, and threats. The first letter of each rubric taken together conveniently generates the acronym FIRST. Special attention is given to the rubrics of functionality and inherent significance given the centrality of the former and the tendency to neglect the latter in virtue of its somewhat nebulous and contested character. In addition to exploring some illustrative issues arising under each rubric, the article also emphasizes a number of more general themes. These include: the multiplicity of interacting levels on which ethical questions about RAIs arise, the need to recognise that RAIs potentially implicate the full gamut of human values (rather than exclusively or primarily some readily identifiable sub-set of ethical or legal principles), and the need for practically salient ethical reflection on RAIs to be informed by a realistic appreciation of their existing and foreseeable capacities.",,3,,,,,,,J Tasioulas,,2051-655X,1,JOURNAL OF PRACTICAL ETHICS,,,,61-95,WOS:000473621300006,,7,,2019,,
ID-344,article,ERASING THE BIAS AGAINST USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO PREDICT FUTURE CRIMINALITY: ALGORITHMS ARE COLOR BLIND AND NEVER TIRE,"Many problems in the criminal justice system would be solved if we could accurately determine which offenders would commit offenses in the future. The likelihood that a person will commit a crime in the future is the single most important consideration that influences sentencing outcomes. It is relevant to the objectives of community protection, specific deterrence, and rehabilitation. The risk of future offending is also a cardinal consideration in bail and probation decisions. Empirical evidence establishes that judges are poor predictors of future offending their decisions are barely more accurate than the toss of a coin. This undermines the efficacy and integrity of the criminal justice system. Modern artificial intelligence systems are much more accurate in determining  if a defendant will commit future crimes. Yet, the move towards using artificial intelligence in the criminal justice system is slowing because of increasing concerns regarding the lack of transparency of algorithms and claims that the algorithms are imbedded
with biased and racist sentiments. Criticisms have also been leveled at the reliability of algorithmic determinations. In this Article, we undertake an examination of the desirability of using algorithms to predict future
offending and in the process analyze the innate resistance that humans have towards deferring decisions of this nature to computers. It emerges that most people have an irrational distrust of computer decision-making. This phenomenon is termed “algorithmic aversion.” We provide a number of recommendations regarding the steps that are necessary to surmount algorithmic aversion and lay the groundwork for the development of fairer and more efficient sentencing, bail, and probation systems.",https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1365&context=uclr,4,,,,,,"provides recommendations, but it's not an empirical study or review",M Bagaric and D Hunter and N Stobbs,,0009-6881,4,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI LAW REVIEW,,,,1037-1081,WOS:000534603600003,,88,https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1365&context=uclr,2019,,

However, it is still unclear about the adaptive mechanisms for plant roots to cope with simultaneous low pH and Al3+ toxicity in the acid soil. In this study, changes in root tip H+, K+ and Ca2+ fluxes and rhizospheric pH of three barley genotypes, including two Tibetan wild barley (XZ16, Al-tolerant; XZ61, Al-sensitive), and Al-tolerant cv Dayton, were investigated using microelectrode ion flux estimation (MIFE) technology. The results showed that Al-induced ion flux changes were mainly occurred at the elongation zone. Under low-pH treatment, at 24 h, the rhizosphere pH of low-pH tolerant XZ16 and Dayton were 0.7 and 0.3 units higher than low-pH sensitive XZ61, respectively. The H+ influx of tolerant XZ16 and Dayton was higher than that of sensitive XZ61 during the whole process of both low-pH and Al treatments. Furthermore, the Al stress significantly increased the Ca2+ efflux, inhibited the K+ efflux and ATPase activities, especially in the Al-sensitive XZ61. These results indicated that the higher low-pH tolerance in XZ16 was connected with the higher ability of H+ uptake and rhizospheric alkalization. The different mechanisms between low -pH and AI tolerance were probably tightly modulated by Al-induced increase of Ca2+ efflux and inhibition of ATPase activities.",,3,,,,,,,W X Liu and X Feng and Y Qiu and Z H Chen and F R Zeng and G P Zhang and F B Wu,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.08.029,0098-8472,,ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,,,,16-24,WOS:000448093600003,,156,,2018,,

ID-348,article,Overcoming aromatase inhibitor resistance in breast cancer: possible mechanisms and clinical applications,"Estrogen plays crucial roles in the progression of hormone-dependent breast cancers through activation of nuclear estrogen receptor alpha (ER). Estrogen is produced locally from circulating inactive steroids and adrenal androgens in postmenopausal women. However, conversion by aromatase is a rate-limiting step in intratumoral estrogen production in breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) inhibit the growth of hormone-dependent breast cancers by blocking the conversion of adrenal androgens to estrogen and by unmasking the inhibitory effect of androgens, acting via the androgen receptor (AR). AIs are thus a standard treatment option for postmenopausal hormone-dependent breast cancer. However, although initial use of AIs provides substantial clinical benefit, some breast cancer patients relapse because of the acquisition of AI resistance. A better understanding of the mechanisms of AI resistance may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies and aid in the search for new therapeutic targets and agents. We have investigated AI-resistance mechanisms and established six AI-resistant cell lines. Some of them exhibit estrogen depletion-resistance properties via constitutive ER-activation or ER-independent growth signaling. We examined how breast cancer cells can adapt to estrogen depletion and androgen superabundance. Estrogen and estrogenic androgen produced independently from aromatase contributed to cell proliferation in some of these cell lines, while another showed AR-dependent cell proliferation. Based on these findings, currently proposed AI-resistance mechanisms include an aromatase-independent estrogen-producing pathway, estrogen-independent ER function, and ER-independent growth signaling. This review summarizes several hypotheses of AI-resistance mechanisms and discusses how existing or novel therapeutic agents may be applied to treat AI-resistant breast cancers.",,3,,,,,,,T Hanamura and S Hayashi,10.1007/s12282-017-0772-1,1340-6868,4,BREAST CANCER,,,,379-391,WOS:000435013300003,,25,,2018,,

In this study, we functionally characterized a Nramp member in sorghum, SbNratl, which is homologous to OsNratl with 88% identity. SbNratl was expressed in both roots and shoots, and its expression was not induced by Al treatment. When expressed in yeast, SbNratl transports trivalent Al ion, but not Mn and Cd. Furthermore, introduction of SbNratl into the rice mutant osnratl can rescue its sensitivity to Al. However, no correlation between AI tolerance and the expression level of SbNratl was found in thirteen sorghum cultivars tested. These results indicate that SbNratl functions as an Al transporter that is possibly involved in basic Al tolerance in sorghum.",,3,,,,,,,M X Lu and Z G Wang and S Fu and G Z Yang and M X Shi and Y S Lu and X H Wang and J X Xia,10.1016/j.plantsci.2017.05.010,0168-9452,,PLANT SCIENCE,,,,18-23,WOS:000407407100003,,262,,2017,,

Some of the findings are the inability of human beings to think statistically, called heuristics and biases, the concept of Anchoring, Availability effect, Substituting effect, Optimism and Loss aversion effect, Framing effect, Sunk costs and Prospect theory where a reference point is important in evaluating choices rather than economic utility. With the advent of decision making using intelligent machines, all these effects and biases are eliminated. System 1, which is intuitive, is eliminated altogether. System 2 becomes the norm, as advances in artificial intelligence are made. System 2 becomes fast because contemporary computational intelligent machines work fast.

The microstructure in the traditional Al/Ti joint consisted of a partially melted zone, a columnar grain zone, and a transition structure. Under the action of EMS, a fine spheroidal grain structure formed in the Al/Ti joint and, compared with the traditional Al/Ti resistance spot weld, the weld created under the EMS effect exhibited a larger bonding diameter, and higher tensile shear force and energy absorption. The large bonding diameter and fine spheroidal grain structure should account for the superior mechanical performance of the Al/Ti EMS joint. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanisms of refractoriness have been investigated by numerous studies but have not been fully clarified. Hormonal therapy resistance, particularly aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistance, may be related to the acquisition of alternative intracellular ER signaling. We have been investing the mechanisms using cancer specimens and cell lines by monitoring the transcription activity of ERs. AI refractory specimens showed diverse ER activity in the adenovirus estrogen receptor element-green fluorescent protein (ERE-GFP) assay and varied sensitivity to anti-estrogens, indicating the existence of multiple resistant mechanisms. We established six different types of cell lines mimicking AI resistance from ERE-GFP-introduced ER-positive cell lines. They revealed that multiple and alternative ER activating pathways were involved in the resistance, such as phosphorylation-dependent or androgen metabolite-dependent mechanisms. The response to fulvestrant and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor also varied among individual resistant cell lines.

ID-357,article,Estrogen receptor signaling as a target for novel breast cancer therapeutics,"In breast cancer (BC) epithelial cells, the mitogenic action of estradiol is transduced through binding to two receptors, ER alpha and ER beta, which act as transcription factors. Anti-estrogens (AEs) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are used clinically to arrest the estrogen-dependent growth of BC. In the case of AE or AI resistance, Herceptin or lapatinib may be used to inhibit growth factors. Estrogen effects are mediated not only through nuclear ERs but also through cytoplasmic/membrane ERs and G-protein-coupled ERs. These estrogen-binding systems associate with various proteins that direct cell cycle signaling, proliferation and survival. The partners of nuclear ER include SRC1-3, HDACs and ER beta itself as well as newly identified proteins, such as E6-AP, LKB1, PELP1, PAX-2 and FOXA1. The partners of extra-nuclear ER alpha include PI3K and the tyrosine kinase Src. These various factors are all potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In addition, BC proliferation is enhanced by insulin and ERF, which stimulate signaling through the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways by activation of the IGF-1R and EGFR axes, respectively. These pathways are tightly interconnected with ER-activated signaling, and membrane ERa forms complexes with Src and PI3K. Chemokine-mediated signaling also modulates the estrogen response. Inhibiting these pathways with specific inhibitors or activating some of the pathways by gene manipulation may be therapeutically valuable for arresting BC cell cycle progression and for inducing apoptosis to antagonize hormone-resistance. Here, we review some newly identified putatively targetable ER partners and highlight the need to develop tumor-targeting drug carrier systems affecting both the tumor cells and the tumor environment.

ID-360,article,Aluminum-stress response in oat genotypes with monogenic tolerance,"Aluminum (Al) toxicity is one of the limiting factors in agricultural productivity on acid soils. The oat genotypes UFRGS17 and UPF91Al100-1-4 have been developed through different breeding programs and are classified as Al-tolerant. Genetic analysis indicated that the Al tolerance in each genotype is conferred by one gene. Pyramiding Al tolerance genes may increase the tolerance level. The objectives of this study were to determine whether the AI-tolerance observed in both genotypes is conferred by different genes and to investigate the tolerance mechanisms. The aluminum tolerance of the F-2 population derived from the UFRGS17 X UPF91Al100-1-4 cross was estimated by using the regrowth of the primary root, and the tolerance was compared to the parental frequency distribution. The tolerance mechanism was investigated in seedlings after Al exposure for seven days. Al accumulation in the root apex was visualized, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the content of non-protein thiol groups and the concentrations of ascorbic acid, superoxide and H2O2 in the root apex, the differentiated root region and the shoots were measured. Al tolerance in UFRGS17 and UPF91Al100-1-4 is conferred by the same gene. A diverse pattern of Al accumulation was obtained for the genotypes, suggesting that the external detoxification is not the main mechanism of tolerance. The tolerant genotypes were able to manage the oxidative stress caused by Al on the other hand the sensitive genotype showed higher oxidative stress and lipid oxidation. The relative importance of each antioxidant component could not be established because different responses were observed between the Al-tolerant genotypes. It is possible that the Al-tolerance gene codifies an upstream component, such as a transcription factor, which once induced by Al, ends up activating, among other pathways, the antioxidative system.

Our data further confirm that therapeutic activation of ER beta by DPN, an ER beta agonist, blocks letrozole-resistant tumor growth in a xenograft model. interestingly. DPN exerted tumor growth inhibition only in the presence of the AI letrozole, suggesting that combination therapy including ER beta activators and AI may be used in the clinical setting treating AI resistant breast cancer. An increase in ER beta levels, with diminished ER alpha/ER beta ratio, was observed in the tumors from mice treated with DPN/letrozole combination compared to single agents and control. Decreased Cyclin D1 and increased CyclinD1/CDK inhibitors p21 and p27 levels in DPN/letrozole treated tumors were observed, suggesting that the combination treatment may inhibit tumor growth by blocking G1/S phase cell cycle progression. Our data show a decrease in MAPK phosphorylation levels without affecting total levels. In addition to providing evidence suggesting the potential use of ER beta agonists in combination with letrozole in treating AI resistant breast cancer and prolonging sensitivity to AI. we also provide mechanistic evidence supporting the role of ER beta in altering the expression profile associated with resistance.

ID-362,article,"An ""Omics"" Approach to Determine the Mechanisms of Acquired Aromatase Inhibitor Resistance","Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the major types of drugs to treat hormone-dependent breast cancer. Although these drugs work effectively, cancer still recurs in many patients after treatment as a result of acquired resistance to the AIs. To characterize the resistant mechanisms, a set of MCF-7aro cell lines that acquired resistance to the AIs was generated. Through an ""Omics'' approach, we found that the resistance mechanisms of the three AIs (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) differ and activation of estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) is critical for acquired AI resistance. Our results reveal that growth factor/signal transduction pathways are upregulated after ER alpha-dependent pathways are suppressed by AIs, and ER alpha can then be activated through different crosstalk mechanisms.",,3,,,,,,,S A Chen,10.1089/omi.2010.0097,1536-2310,6,OMICS-A JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY,,,,347-352,WOS:000291198200002,,15,,2011,,
ID-363,article,"Molecular characterization of aromatase inhibitor-resistant, tamoxifen-resistant and LTEDaro cell lines","To determine potential genes involved in mediating resistance to aromatase inhibitors (AIs), a microarray study was performed using MCF-7aro (aromatase overexpressing) cells that are resistant to letrozole (T + LET R), anastrozole (T + ANA R) and exemestane (T + EXE R), as well as LTEDaro and tamoxifen-resistant (T +TAM R) lines for comparison. Based on hierarchical clustering, estrogen-responsive genes were found to be differentially expressed in AI-resistant lines versus LTEDaro and T+TAM R. Additional genome-wide analysis showed that gene expression profiles of the non-steroidal AI-resistant lines were most closely correlated and that T+EXE R lines exhibit differing profiles. Also, LTEDaro and T +TAM R lines are inherently different from expression profiles of AI-resistant lines. Further characterization of these resistant lines revealed that T+ LET R, T +ANA R and LTEDaro cells contain a constitutively active estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) that does not require the ligand estrogen for activation. Ligand-independent activation of ER alpha does not activate identical estrogen-responsive gene profiles in AI-resistant lines as in LTEDaro lines, thereby establishing differing mechanisms of resistance. This ligand-independent activation of ER was not observed in the parental cell lines MCF-7aro, T+ EXE Rot T +TAM R cells. Based on the steroidal structure of EXE, our laboratory has shown that this AI has weak estrogen-like properties, and that EXE resistance involves an ER-dependent crosstalk with EGFR growth factor signaling. Recent studies in our laboratory pertaining to pre-clinical models of AI treatment revealed that intermittent use of EXE delays the onset of acquired resistance in comparison to continuous treatment. Specific molecular mechanisms involved in intermittent use of EXE are currently being explored, based on microarray gene expression profiling. Lastly, our laboratory has initiated a study of microRNAs and their potential role in regulating target genes involved in AI-resistance. Overall, we propose a model of acquired resistance that progresses from hormone-dependence (T +TAM R and T+EXER) to hormone-independence (T + LET R and T + ANA R), eventually resulting in hormone-independence that does not rely on conventional ER signaling (LTEDaro).

ID-364,article,Constitutive and aluminium-induced patterns of phenolic compounds in two maize varieties differing in aluminium tolerance,"Aluminium tolerance in maize is mainly due to more efficient AI exclusion. Nonetheless, even in tolerant varieties AI can gain access into the cells. Detoxification by binding to strong organic ligands should therefore play a role also in plants with high AI exclusion capacity. To test this hypothesis in this study the concentrations of soluble, free and bound, phenolics were analyzed in roots of two maize varieties differing in AI tolerance. Exposure for 24 h to 50 mu M AI in nutrient solution strongly inhibited root elongation in the sensitive variety 16 x 36, but not in the AI-tolerant variety Cateto. Cateto accumulated about half the concentration of Al in roots than 16 x 36 (analysis performed after root desorption with citrate). Roots of AI-tolerant Cateto contained higher concentrations of caffeic acid, catechol and catechin than roots of the sensitive variety. Exposure to AI induced the accumulation of taxifolin in roots of both varieties. However. Al-tolerant Cateto accumulated about twice the concentration than Al-sensitive 16 x 36 of this pentahydroxyfavonol. The molar ratio for phenolics with catecholate groups to AI was about unity in roots of Cateto, while in those of 16 x 36 the ratio was ten times lower. Both the fact that these phenolics are strong ligands for Al and their high antioxidant and antiradical activity suggest that these compounds may provide protection against the AI fraction that is able to surpass the exclusion mechanisms operating in the tolerant maize variety.

Some maize lines show aluminum (AI) tolerance, and exudation of organic acids by roots has been considered to represent an important mechanism involved in the tolerance. However, there is no information about the impact of liming on the structures of bacterial and fungal communities in Cerrado soil, nor if there are differences between the microbial communities from the rhizospheres of Al-tolerant and Al-sensitive maize lines. This study evaluated the effects of liming on the structure of bacterial and fungal communities in bulk soil and rhizospheres of Al-sensitive and Al-tolerant maize (Zea mays L.) lines cultivated in Cerrado soil by PCR-DGGE, 30 and 90 days after sowing. Bacterial fingerprints revealed that the bacterial communities from rhizospheres were more affected by aluminum stress in soil than by the maize line (Al-sensitive or Al-tolerant). Differences in bacterial communities were also observed over time (30 and 90 days after sowing), and these occurred mainly in the Actinobacteria. Conversely, fungal communities from the rhizosphere were weakly affected either by liming or by the rhizosphere, as observed from the DGGE profiles. Furthermore, only a few differences were observed in the DGGE profiles of the fungal populations during plant development when compared with bacterial communities.

ID-368,article,"<i>AtALMT1</i>, which encodes a malate transporter, is identified as one of several genes critical for aluminum tolerance in <i>Arabidopsis</i>","Aluminum (Al) tolerance in Arabidopsis is a genetically complex trait, yet it is mediated by a single physiological mechanism based on Al-activated root malate efflux. We investigated a possible molecular determinant for Al tolerance involving a homolog of the wheat Al-activated malate transporter, ALMT1. This gene, named AtALMT1(At1 g08430), was the best candidate from the 14-member AtALMT family to be involved with Al tolerance based on expression patterns and genomic location. Physiological analysis of a transferred DNA knockout mutant for AtALMT1 as well as electro-physiological examination of the protein expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed that AtALMT1 is critical for Arabidopsis Al tolerance and encodes the Al-activated root malate efflux transporter associated with tolerance. However, gene expression and sequence analysis of AtALMT1 alleles from tolerant Columbia (Col), sensitive Landsberg erecta (Ler), and other ecotypes that varied in Al tolerance suggested that variation observed at AtALMT1 is not correlated with the differences observed in Al tolerance among these ecotypes. Genetic complementation experiments indicated that the Ler allele of AtALMT1 is equally effective as the Col allele in conferring Al tolerance and Al-activated malate release. Finally, fine-scale mapping of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for Al tolerance on chromosome 1 indicated that AtALMT1 is located proximal to this QTL. These results indicate that AtALMT1 is an essential factor for AI tolerance in Arabidopsis but does not represent the major Al tolerance QTL also found on chromosome 1.",,3,,,,,,,O A Hoekenga and L G Maron and M A Piñeros and G M A Cançado and J Shaff and Y Kobayashi and P R Ryan and B Dong and E Delhaize and T Sasaki and H Matsumoto and Y Yamamoto and H Koyama and L V Kochian,10.1073/pnas.0602868103,0027-8424,25,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,,,,9738-9743,WOS:000238660400063,,103,,2006,,
ID-369,article,Life following aromatase inhibitors - where now for endocrine sequencing?,"The third-generation non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are challenging tamoxifen as treatments of choice for early and advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease. However, patients who initially respond to AIs eventually develop resistance to treatment and experience disease progression. To establish the optimal endocrine therapy following AI resistance, it is essential to understand the mechanisms that contribute to the loss of response. Data from in vitro models have suggested that acquired AI resistance is due to enhanced sensitization to low estrogen levels during long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED). Cross-talk between the ER and various growth-factor-receptor signaling pathways, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and the insulin-like growth factor pathway, may also be implicated. Therefore, endocrine therapies that abolish estrogen signaling via removal of the ER could be effective in patients with AI-resistant disease. Fulvestrant ('Faslodex') is a new ER antagonist with no agonist effects that binds, blocks and degrades the ER. Due to its unique mode of action and lack of cross-resistance with existing treatments, fulvestrant is an effective therapeutic agent for use in sequential endocrine regimens. Fulvestrant has established efficacy in tamoxifen-resistant disease and there is a growing body of evidence demonstrating its efficacy in patients with AI-resistant disease. In preclinical models, MCF-7 cells undergoing LTED are refractory to tamoxifen but sensitive to fulvestrant, suggesting fulvestrant is a more appropriate choice following AI resistance. The steroidal AI, exemestane is also an option in nonsteroidal AI-resistant disease. Clinical trials are underway to compare fulvestrant with exemestane as an appropriate therapy following the onset of AI resistance.",,3,,,,,,,S R Johnston and L A Martin and M Dowsett,10.1007/s10549-005-9038-2,0167-6806,,BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT,,,,S19-S25,WOS:000233163400004,,93,,2005,,
ID-370,article,Genotypic difference in aluminum resistance and oxalate exudation of buckwheat,"Genotypic difference in aluminum (AI) resistance of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench.) was first tested using a simple salt solution (0.5 mM CaCl12) containing 25 muM AlCl3. Two contrasting genotypes, resistant 92-1 vs. sensitive Liangqiao 1, were selected out of five, and further tested by a long-term At treatment in 115 strength of Hoagland solution. Consistent results were obtained by the two methods although much higher Al3+ concentration was needed to cause the genotypic difference in the culture solution (up to 2000 muM compared with 25 muM Al3+ in simple salt solution). Oxalate content and exudation was decreased when the plants were subjected to the long-term Al treatment of both genotypes, 92-1, however, excreted more oxalate than Liangqiao I either in Al-treated or non-treated plants. If the plants were treated with 100 muM Al3+ in 0.5 mM CaCl2 solution for 24h,oxalate exudation was very significantly induced: 4-fold increase for 92-1 and 1-fold increase for Liangqiao 1. This supports the previous report that Al-induced oxalate exudation is a rapid response and may not last a long time. It is, therefore, suggested that the constitutive excreted and internal oxalate may be able to contribute more than the induced oxalate in copying with Al toxicity as well as conferring the genotypic difference especially when the stress is strong and lasting.",,3,,,,,,,X X Peng and L Yu and C Yang and Y H Liu,10.1081/PLN-120023281,0190-4167,9,JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION,,,,1767-1777,WOS:000184965400005,,26,,2003,,

In this study, a doubled-haploid population derived from the rice (Oryza sativa L.) breeding lines CT9993 and IR62266 was used to map genes controlling A1 tolerance. A. genetic linkage map consisting of 280 DNA markers (RFLP, AFLP and SSR) was constructed to determine the position and nature of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting AI tolerance. Three characters - control root length (CRL), Al-stressed root length (SRL) and root length ratio (RR) - were evaluated for the DH lines and the parents at the seedling stage in nutrient solution. A total of 20 QTLs controlling root growth under A1 stress and control conditions were detected and distributed over 10 of the 12 rice chromosomes, reflecting multigenic control of these traits. The two QTLs of largest effect, qALRR-1-1 and qALRR-8 for root length ratio (a measurement of Al tolerance) were localized on chromosomes 1 and 8. respectively. Three other QTLs in addition to qALRR-8 were apparently unique in the CT9993 x IR62266 mapping population. which may explain the high level of Al tolerance in CT9993.

ID-373,article,Modification of the culture medium to produce aluminum toxicity in cell suspensions of coffee (<i>Coffea arabica</i> L.),"Coffee (Coffea arabica) plants are usually grown in soils containing high levels of organic materials. Under these conditions, aluminum (Al) is toxic because of the acidic nature of the soils. Al is the most abundant metal found in the earth's crust and occurs in a number of different forms in soil. In acid soils, AI toxicity is a global problem that limits crop productivity. A major problem in obtaining cellular lines displaying AI tolerance in culture is the composition of the medium. In the experiments presented here, we modified the composition of the culture medium for a C. arabica cell line to produce Al toxicity. Murashige-Skoog media was used, complete (MS) and half ionic strength (MSHIS), at either pH 5.8 or 4.3. We found that MSHIS and pH 4.3 provided the optimal conditions to obtain Al toxicity as measured by the ability to grow in a range of Al concentrations (25-1,000 muM). The lethal dose (LD50) under these conditions was 25 muM. The concentrations of free Al in the culture medium were corroborated by the fluorescent compound Morin.

ID-377,article,DECISION-ANALYSIS APPROACH TO BRUSH MANAGEMENT PLANNING - RAMIFICATIONS FOR INTEGRATED RANGE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"Simulation, optimization, and other modeling paradigms for systems ecology and economics have not been broadly applied to development of models for range resource management in realworld settings. The lag in emergence of applicable management models may be attributed to the lack of a conceptual context for their application. Recent appreciation of the decision-analysis approach to natural resource management and the general availability of high-speed computing capabilities have provided viable bases for using increasingly sophisticated analytical tools to solve management problems. Decision models may be used to generate proforma contrasts of selected management alternatives for multienterprise firms and implementation protocols for the selected management program(s). Such models, operating from a computer-managed information base, become decision-support systems (DSS) for approaching specific management problems; Integrated Brush Management Systems (IBMS) is one example. These DSS are proposed at the first step toward creating comprehensive decision-making models for total resource management (i.e. Integrated Range Resource Management or Integrated Range Resource Analysis). The next generation of models will link quaalitative information and rules-of-thumb (heuristics) with hard (experimentally derived) data.

This study constructs a model linking the uses and gratifications of algorithmic recommendation apps with algorithmic dependence, with a particular focus on fatigue as a key mediator in explaining the psychological mechanism behind the formation of algorithmic app dependence. Snowball sampling was employed for data collection, and a total of 354 valid questionnaires were collected via the online survey tool (i.e., WJX platform). The results show that the use of algorithmic recommendation apps has a direct positive effect on algorithmic app dependence. While all three types of user gratification obtained (i.e., information gratification, entertainment gratification, and expression gratification) are positively related to algorithmic app dependence, the mediating role of fatigue varies: entertainment gratification indirectly reduces algorithmic app dependence by increasing fatigue, whereas expression gratification indirectly increases algorithmic app dependence by reducing fatigue. The theoretical contributions and practical implications of the research findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2024.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196192094&doi=10.1057%2fs41599-024-03221-z&partnerID=40&md5=3abd82d64693cfc469685456835257bd,3,,,,,,,R Qiao and C Liu and J Xu,10.1057/s41599-024-03221-z,,1,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196192094&doi=10.1057%2fs41599-024-03221-z&partnerID=40&md5=3abd82d64693cfc469685456835257bd,2024,,
ID-379,article,An improved chaos sparrow search algorithm for UAV path planning,"This study suggests an improved chaos sparrow search algorithm to overcome the problems of slow convergence speed and trapping in local optima in UAV 3D complex environment path planning. First, the quality of the initial solutions is improved by using a piecewise chaotic mapping during the population initialization phase. Secondly, a nonlinear dynamic weighting factor is introduced to optimize the update equation of producers, reducing the algorithm's reliance on producer positions and balancing its global and local exploration capabilities. In the meantime, an enhanced sine cosine algorithm optimizes the update equation of the scroungers to broaden the search space and prevent blind searches. Lastly, a dynamic boundary lens imaging reverse learning strategy is applied to prevent the algorithm from getting trapped in local optima. Experiments of UAV path planning on simple and complex maps are conducted. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms CSSA, SSA, and PSO algorithms with a respective time improvement of 22.4%, 28.8%, and 46.8% in complex environments and exhibits high convergence accuracy, which validates the proposed algorithm's usefulness and superiority. © 2024, The Author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181239529&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-023-50484-8&partnerID=40&md5=5dafd6775d784e8f41e4b4e4eb481b54,3,,,,,,,Y He and M Wang,10.1038/s41598-023-50484-8,,1,Scientific Reports,,,Cited By :2,,,,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181239529&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-023-50484-8&partnerID=40&md5=5dafd6775d784e8f41e4b4e4eb481b54,2024,,
ID-380,article,Overcoming ‘Digital Divides’: Leveraging higher education to develop next generation digital agriculture professionals,"Agriculture 4.0 technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things, Computer Vision, and Robotics, have revolutionized the agricultural sector. But the adoption of digital technologies has arguably created new or exacerbated existing socioeconomic disparities, while raising ethical issues, particularly when considering technology access and adoption. So far, the literature has placed little emphasis on how to effectively bridge knowledge and skills disparities in the agriculture sector—or mend agriculture's ‘digital divides’—through workforce development strategies that leverage higher education and extension programs. In this article, we argue that academic programs have a much bigger role to play via educational and extension efforts to equip tomorrow's AI-ready workforce.

ID-381,article,DETECTing the anomalies: Exploring implications of qualitative research in identifying AI-generated text for AI-assisted composition instruction,"This study inspires new pedagogical practices with evolving technological innovations. One example of such innovation is the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in education. The potential impact of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, on composition education has caused concerns among educators due to its human-like writing capabilities. However, there is no escape from ChatGPT-generated text, which is influenced by prompt engineering. Such engineering can lead to underlying issues in content, prompting a pedagogical opportunity for understanding human-written and AI-generated texts. Since, to this date, there is no single reliable source for identifying AI-generated text, this study introduces a pedagogical approach, DETECT, with two major goals: (1) explore the nuances that differentiate human expression from the algorithmic patterns and tendencies of generative AI writing and (2) inspire ways to integrate generative AI in composition instruction in a post-plagiarism era. Using exploratory practice research, this article examines DETECT in composition instruction of 32 students during Fall 2023 and Spring 2024. The findings showed that using DETECT improved students’ confidence in analyzing human-written and AI-generated texts, which enhanced their recognition and appreciation of their own writing voice. The study concludes with pedagogical implications for the possibilities of generative AI in writing instruction. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196556618&doi=10.1016%2fj.compcom.2024.102869&partnerID=40&md5=54c6e5246b57fd7cc4fa97921d17b021,3,,,,,,,A Garib and T A Coffelt,10.1016/j.compcom.2024.102869,,,Computers and Composition,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,73,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196556618&doi=10.1016%2fj.compcom.2024.102869&partnerID=40&md5=54c6e5246b57fd7cc4fa97921d17b021,2024,,
ID-382,article,Understanding the effects of socioeconomic factors on housing price appreciation using explainable AI,"Housing price appreciation is an important socioeconomic phenomenon that captures the complex socioeconomic dynamics of a city. Variation in housing price appreciation across neighborhoods reflects localized housing demand and supply-side factors. This study develops quality-adjusted, census tract-level housing price indices using a fine-grained big dataset containing a total of 140,289 housing transactions in the County of Los Angeles. We employ the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique, an explainable artificial intelligence framework, to examine the underlying demographic and socioeconomic factors that help in explaining the variance in tract-level housing price appreciation from 2012 through 2018 in the County of Los Angeles. The novelty of the methodology lies in the local interpretation of spatial patterns it provides from big data in the urban context and in assessing how the factors influencing housing price appreciation vary geographically. The modeling framework could help planners in making informed decisions about local geographic contexts that contribute to variability in housing price appreciation in cities. © 2024 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198578073&doi=10.1016%2fj.apgeog.2024.103339&partnerID=40&md5=b3c13ad1e50bfd04454f8d2be2e0c901,3,,,,,,,S Jin and H Zheng and N Marantz and A Roy,10.1016/j.apgeog.2024.103339,,,Applied Geography,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,169,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198578073&doi=10.1016%2fj.apgeog.2024.103339&partnerID=40&md5=b3c13ad1e50bfd04454f8d2be2e0c901,2024,,
ID-383,article,Edge artificial intelligence for big data: a systematic review,"Edge computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) concepts have become increasingly prevalent in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. As the number of IoT devices continues to grow, relying solely on cloud computing for real-time data processing and analysis is proving to be more challenging. The synergy between edge computing and AI is particularly intriguing due to AI's reliance on rapid data processing, a capability facilitated by edge computing. Edge AI represents a significant paradigm shift, leveraging AI within edge computing frameworks to reduce reliance on internet connections and mitigate data latency issues. This approach accelerates data processing, supporting use cases that demand real-time inference. Additionally, as cloud storage costs continue to rise, the feasibility of streaming and storing large volumes of data comes into question. Edge AI offers a compelling solution by performing big data analytics closer to the end device where edge computing is deployed. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of 85 articles published between 2018 and 2023 within Edge AI. The study provides a comprehensive examination of the analysis of measurement environments and assesses factors applied to Edge AI for big data. It offers taxonomies specific to Edge AI within the big data domain, presents case studies, and outlines the challenges and open issues inherent in Edge AI for big data. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190664823&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-024-09723-w&partnerID=40&md5=db6240354afb9b6a1ac8ee4a07fc04f1,3,,,,,,,A Hemmati and P Raoufi and A M Rahmani,10.1007/s00521-024-09723-w,,19,Neural Computing and Applications,,,Cited By :1,11461-11494,,,36,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190664823&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-024-09723-w&partnerID=40&md5=db6240354afb9b6a1ac8ee4a07fc04f1,2024,,

ID-385,article,Risk-averse behavior and incentive policies: A new perspective on spatial–temporal traceability supervision in construction logistics supply chains,"Spatial-temporal decision support systems (STDSS) serve as a crucial strategy for enhancing operational governance and mitigating risk within construction logistics. However, construction supply chains involve many opaque stakeholders, hindering whole industry compliance monitoring. This research formulates a tripartite evolutionary game model that scrutinizes the strategic interactions among government regulators, carriers, and contractors, thereby offering insights into the collaborative supervision outcomes shaped by these stakeholder engagements. Government regulators choose intelligent supervision incentives versus regular oversight. Carriers decide whether to invest in STDSS or not. Contractors cooperate by enrolling or declining STDSS. As key STDSS investors, carriers’ decisions are investigated under varying risk preferences in an extension model. This examines how government incentives influence long-term intelligent supervision and risk aversion behavior emergence to improve safety and quality across construction supply chains. Our findings indicate that increased adverse events motivate government regulators to adopt STDSS incentives for oversight, though carriers and contractors are not necessarily prompted to implement STDSS themselves. Escalating risk aversion reduces carrier STDSS adoption likelihood as they maintain basic services. Carriers perceiving contractor free riding as unfair competition also demotivates STDSS rollout. Although larger subsidies initially raise STDSS implementation probability, carriers become unwilling to adopt STDSS over time even with greater subsidies. In summary, adverse events drive regulator but not necessarily carrier and contractor STDSS adoption, while risk aversion, perceived fairness and changing subsidy effectiveness over time shape carrier decisions. © 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194777164&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2024.110256&partnerID=40&md5=e24564d77f6b45eb0edf9ded366c342c,3,,,,,,,M Zhang and Q Shen and Z Zhao and S Wang and G Q Huang,10.1016/j.cie.2024.110256,,,Computers and Industrial Engineering,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,192,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194777164&doi=10.1016%2fj.cie.2024.110256&partnerID=40&md5=e24564d77f6b45eb0edf9ded366c342c,2024,,
ID-386,article,Image encryption algorithm based on COA and hyperchaotic Lorenz system,"Aiming at the problems of weak security and susceptibility to violent cracking in traditional image encryption algorithms, this paper presents a novel image encryption algorithm based on the Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA) and the hyperchaotic Lorenz system. The hyperchaotic Lorenz system exhibits sensitivity to both initial conditions and parameters, and complex dynamics behavior. These characteristics pose a challenge for attackers attempting to extract essential information from the image through analysis, thereby enhancing the algorithm's resistance to cracking. Nevertheless, the hyperchaotic Lorenz system is susceptible to the initial values of state variables, and its initial parameters can be easily deciphered. Consequently, this study suggests employing the COA to optimize the sequence generated by the chaotic system. This is done to increase the randomness and complexity of the key, making it more challenging to crack. Given that COA gets trapped in local optima when dealing with high-dimensional problems, this paper proposes the Lévy-flight Coyote Optimization Algorithm (LCOA). By implementing the LCOA, which involves larger step sizes and faster jumps, the algorithm is expected to achieve global optimality during the optimization search process. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimization results of the generated sequence of the hyperchaotic Lorenz system by LCOA can eliminate patterns and regularities of pixel points in the image generated effectively. This leads to a significant enhancement in the resistance of the image encryption algorithm to differential attacks, resulting in a significant enhancement in image encryption performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192109600&doi=10.1007%2fs11071-024-09632-6&partnerID=40&md5=9329cc1f2f98caa9e8a80efc62b3b790,3,,,,,,,X Qin and Y Zhang,10.1007/s11071-024-09632-6,,12,Nonlinear Dynamics,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,10611-10632,,,112,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192109600&doi=10.1007%2fs11071-024-09632-6&partnerID=40&md5=9329cc1f2f98caa9e8a80efc62b3b790,2024,,

ID-388,article,Defining artificial intelligence for librarians,"The aim of the paper is to define Artificial Intelligence (AI) for librarians by examining general definitions of AI, analysing the umbrella of technologies that make up AI, defining types of use case by area of library operation, and then reflecting on the implications for the profession, including from an equality, diversity and inclusion perspective. The paper is a conceptual piece based on an exploratory literature review, targeting librarians interested in AI from a strategic rather than a technical perspective. Five distinct types of use cases of AI are identified for libraries, each with its own underlying drivers and barriers, and skills demands. They are applications in library back-end processes, in library services, through the creation of communities of data scientists, in data and AI literacy and in user management. Each of the different applications has its own drivers and barriers. It is hard to anticipate the impact on professional work but as information environment becomes more complex it is likely that librarians will continue to have a very important role, especially given AI’s dependence on data. However, there could be some negative impacts on equality, diversity and inclusion if AI skills are not spread widely. © The Author(s) 2022.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145332767&doi=10.1177%2f09610006221142029&partnerID=40&md5=08abe729bd956f2268397ac89240d274,3,,,,,,,A M Cox and S Mazumdar,10.1177/09610006221142029,,2,Journal of Librarianship and Information Science,,,Cited By :17,330-340,,,56,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145332767&doi=10.1177%2f09610006221142029&partnerID=40&md5=08abe729bd956f2268397ac89240d274,2024,,

ID-391,article,"The Subversive AI Acceptance Scale (SAIA-8): A Scale to Measure User Acceptance of AI-Generated, Privacy-Enhancing Image Modifications","To resist government and corporate use of facial recognition to surveil users through their personal images, researchers have created privacy-enhancing image filters that use adversarial machine learning. These “subversive AI” (SAI) image filters aim to defend users from facial recognition by distorting personal images in ways that are barely noticeable to humans but confusing to computer vision algorithms. SAI filters are limited, however, by the lack of rigorous user evaluation that assess their acceptability. We addressed this limitation by creating and validating a scale to measure user acceptance - the SAIA-8. In a three-step process, we apply a mixed-methods approach that closely adhered to best practices for scale creation and validation in measurement theory. Initially, to understand the factors that influence user acceptance of SAI filter outputs, we interviewed 15 participants. Interviewees disliked extant SAI filter outputs because of a perceived lack of usefulness and conflicts with their desired self-presentation. Using insights and statements from the interviews, we generated 106 potential items for the scale. Employing an iterative refinement and validation process with 245 participants from Prolific, we arrived at the SAIA-8 scale: a set of eight items that capture user acceptability of privacy-enhancing perturbations to personal images, and that can aid in benchmarking and prioritizing user acceptability when developing and evaluating new SAI filters. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193250186&doi=10.1145%2f3641024&partnerID=40&md5=e8a64f466cd65813f51b6b9dc9117f28,3,,,,,,scale development,J Logas and P Garg and R I Arriaga and S Das,10.1145/3641024,,CSCW1,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193250186&doi=10.1145%2f3641024&partnerID=40&md5=e8a64f466cd65813f51b6b9dc9117f28,2024,,

ID-396,article,Delegation of purchasing tasks to AI: The role of perceived choice and decision autonomy,"Although artificial intelligence (AI) outperforms humans in many tasks, research suggests some consumers are still averse to having AI perform tasks on their behalf. Informed by the literature of customer decision-making process, we propose and show that consumer autonomy is a significant predictor of customers' decision to adopt AI in the purchasing context. Across three experiments, we found that the delegation of purchasing tasks to AI, which restricts choice and decision dimensions of consumers' perceived autonomy, reduces the likelihood of AI adoption. Our results show that the effects of choice and decision autonomy on AI adoption holds even when product choice evaluation is complex. We also found that identity-relevant consumption moderates this relationship, such that it interacts with choice and decision autonomy. Specifically, despite lacking choice and decision autonomy, those who identify strongly with a given activity are more likely to use an AI-enabled app to purchase the product needed to perform this activity. With these insights into when and why consumers are likely to use AI-enabled technology, firms might effectively increase its adoption. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0167923623002415?via%3Dihub,1,1,1,shopping,,"varied choice autonomy and decision autonomy.

ID-397,article,EXPLORING COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THROUGH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is now affecting all aspects of our social lives. Without always knowing it, we interact daily with intelligent systems. They serve us invisibly. At least that’s the goal we assign to them: to make our lives better, task by task. Artificial intelligence has the potential to make biology education more engaging, personalized, and effective by providing students with interactive simulations, personalized learning experiences, and other tools that help them understand complex biological concepts. In this paper, we discuss the integration of AI into the virtual classroom, which significantly enhances student learning experiences in various ways. The study shows that an effective integration of technology into the virtual classroom requires a thoughtful approach that aligns with educational goals and the specific needs of students. In fact, interactive simulations can help make biology more engaging and memorable for students. Besides, personalized learning AI algorithms can help biology students receive a more tailored and effective learning experience, helping them to better understand the course material and develop a deeper appreciation for the natural world. In this work, we will discuss the use of AI to enhance interactive simulation-based cellular processes, with additional application in anatomy, physiology, and ecology teaching.

Methods: To validate the observed differences, statistical analysis, specifically the Mann–Whitney U test, was employed. Results: The results confirm the presence of statistically significant differences between SMEs and large enterprises across multiple dimensions of AI support in project management. Large enterprises exhibit on average a higher level of AI adoption across all five AI utilization dimensions. Specifically, large enterprises scored significantly higher (p < 0.05) in AI adopting strategies and in adopting AI technologies for project tasks and team creation. This study’s findings also underscored the significant differences (p < 0.05) between SMEs and large enterprises in their adoption and utilization of AI technologies for project management purposes. While large enterprises scored above 4 for several dimensions, with the highest average score assessed (mean value 4.46 on 1 to 5 scale) for the usage of predictive Analytics Tools to improve the work on the project, SMEs’ average levels, on the other hand, were all below 4. SMEs in particular may lag in incorporating AI into various project activities due to several factors such as resource constraints, limited access to AI expertise, or risk aversion. Conclusions: The results underscore the need for targeted strategies to enhance AI adoption in SMEs and leverage its benefits for successful project implementation and strengthen the company’s competitiveness. © 2024 by the authors.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188712152&doi=10.3390%2fai5010008&partnerID=40&md5=0d4e111c50a572164cb46c2cacdcf316,3,,,,,,,P Tominc and D Oreški and V Čančer and M Rožman,10.3390/ai5010008,,1,AI (Switzerland),,,Cited By :1,136-157,,,5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188712152&doi=10.3390%2fai5010008&partnerID=40&md5=0d4e111c50a572164cb46c2cacdcf316,2024,,
ID-399,article,"Artificial intelligence in Jordanian education: Assessing acceptance via perceived cybersecurity, novelty value, and perceived trust","The growing significance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across different fields highlights the es-sential role of user acceptance, as the success of this technology largely depends on its adoption and practical use by individuals. This research aims to examine how perceived cybersecurity, novelty value, and perceived trust affect students' willingness to accept AI in educational settings. The study's theoretical basis is the AI Device Use Acceptance (AIDUA) model. Using structural equation modeling, the study tested hypothesized relationships using data from 526 students at Jordanian universities. The results showed that social influence is positively associated with performance expectancy, while perceived cybersecurity is positively related to both performance and effort expectancy. Novelty value is positively associated with performance expectancy but a neg-ative one with effort expectancy. Additionally, effort and performance expectancy significantly influence perceived trust and the willingness to accept AI. Moreover, perceived trust has a notable positive effect on the willingness to accept AI in education. These findings provide valuable guid-ance for the creation and improvement of AI-driven educational systems in universities, contrib-uting to the broader understanding of AI technology acceptance in the educational field. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185688119&doi=10.5267%2fj.ijdns.2023.12.022&partnerID=40&md5=804a18984aa2e5f226fa73c5082aa3fe,1,1,1,,,,"authors make the point that user acceptance is a key aspect of the success of a technology.

ID-400,article,Leadership styles and AI acceptance in academic libraries in higher education,"This study explored the relationship between the leadership styles adopted by academic librarians and their openness to artificial intelligence (AI). The purpose was to discern whether particular leadership approaches influence librarians' attitudes and acceptance of AI technologies in higher education. Data was collected from 50 librarians across four Arab countries. Two distinct questionnaires were administered to the participants: the first focused on their perceptions of AI, exploring attitudes, beliefs, and understanding of AI technologies, while the second implemented the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5×) to assess the librarians' leadership styles. Correlational analysis, inferential statistics including structural equation model, and regression analysis were employed leading to explore the predictive power of various leadership styles on librarians' openness to AI. Findings suggest that the implementation of AI in academic libraries is most likely to occur under transformational leadership, with transactional leadership being associated with suboptimal outcomes; a noteworthy association is observed between the perception of ease of use and the adoption of laissez-faire leadership. The insights derived from this study hold particular significance for the development of librarians' professional training programs, offering valuable guidance on fostering adaptive leadership strategies that align with the evolving landscape of AI integration within academic library settings. © 2024 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183289397&doi=10.1016%2fj.acalib.2024.102849&partnerID=40&md5=62bdf5e6cee6aa2d22734c8efa27c972,3,,,,,,"How do people's attitudes, beliefs, and understanding of AI technologies relate to their acceptance of AI?",T Shal and N Ghamrawi and H Naccache,10.1016/j.acalib.2024.102849,,2,Journal of Academic Librarianship,,,Cited By :5,,,,50,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183289397&doi=10.1016%2fj.acalib.2024.102849&partnerID=40&md5=62bdf5e6cee6aa2d22734c8efa27c972,2024,,
ID-401,article,Toward human-centered AI management: Methodological challenges and future directions,"As algorithms powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly involved in the management of organizations, it becomes imperative to conduct human-centered AI management research and understand people's feelings and behaviors when machines gain power over humans. The two mainstream methods – vignette studies and case studies – reveal important but inconsistent insights. Here we discuss the respective limitations of vignette studies (affective forecasting errors, biased media coverage, and question substitution) and case studies (social desirability biases and lack of random assignment and control conditions), which may lead them to overrate negative and positive reactions to AI management, respectively. We further discuss the advantages of a third method for mitigating these limitations: field experiments on crowdsourced marketplaces. A proof-of-concept study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk; as a world-leading crowdsourcing platform) showed unique human reactions to AI management, which were not perfectly aligned with those in vignette or case studies. Participants (N = 504) did not differ significantly under AI versus human management, in terms of performance, intrinsic motivation, fairness perception, and commitment. We suggest that crowdsourced marketplaces can go beyond human research subject pools and become models of AI-managed workplaces, facilitating timely behavioral research and robust predictions on human-centered work designs and organizations. © 2024 The Authors",https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0166497224000038?via%3Dihub#sec4,1,1,1,management,fairness,2 (manager: algorithm vs. human) by 2 (evaluation: correct or incorrect) between-participants design,methodological contribution. showing how measurement via vignette studies and case studies yields distorted conclusions about algorithm aversion,M Dong and J.-F.

ID-402,article,FOSTERING TRUST THROUGH BYTES: UNRAVELLING THE IMPACT OF E-GOVERNMENT ON PUBLIC TRUST IN INDONESIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT,"Aim/Purpose This study aims to investigate the influence of e-government public services on public trust at the local government level, addressing the pressing need to understand the factors shaping citizen perceptions and trust in government institutions. Background With the proliferation of e-government initiatives worldwide, governments are increasingly turning to digital solutions to enhance public service delivery and promote transparency. However, despite the potential benefits, there remains a gap in understanding how these initiatives impact public trust in government institutions, particularly at the local level. This study seeks to address this gap by examining the relationship between e-government service quality, individual perceptions, and public trust, providing valuable insights into the complexities of citizen-government interactions in the digital age. Methodology Employing a quantitative approach, this study utilises surveys distributed to users of e-government services in one of the regencies in Indonesia. The sample consists of 278 individuals. Data analysis is conducted using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling, allowing for the exploration of relationships among variables and their influence on public trust. Contribution This study provides insights into the factors influencing public trust in e-government services at the local government level, offering a nuanced understanding of the relationship between service quality, individual perceptions, and public trust. Findings This study emphasises information quality and service quality in e-government-based public services as crucial determinants of individual perception in rural areas. Interestingly, system quality in e-government services has no influence on individual perception. In the individual perception, perceived security and privacy emerge as the strongest antecedent of public trust, highlighting the need to guarantee secure and private services for citizens in rural areas. These findings emphasise the importance of prioritising high-quality information, excellent service delivery, and robust security measures to foster and sustain public trust in e-government services. Recommendations Practitioners must prioritise enhancing the quality of e-government services due for Practitioners to their significant impact on individual perception, leading to higher public trust. Government agencies must ensure reliability, responsiveness, and the effective fulfilment of user needs. Additionally, upholding high standards of information quality in e-government services by delivering accurate, relevant, and timely information remains crucial. Strengthening security measures through robust protocols such as data encryption and secure authentication becomes essential for protecting user data. With that in mind, the authors believe that public trust in government would escalate. Recommendations Researchers could investigate the relation between system quality in e-govern-for Researchers ment services and individual perception in different rural settings. Longitudinal studies could also elucidate how evolving service quality, information quality, and security measures impact user satisfaction and trust over time. Comparative studies across regions or countries can reveal cultural and contextual differences in individual perceptions, identifying both universal principles and region-specific strategies for e-government platforms. Analysing user behaviour and preferences across various demographic groups can inform targeted interventions. Furthermore, examining the potential of emerging technologies such as block-chain or artificial intelligence in enhancing e-government service delivery, security, and user engagement remains an interesting topic. Impact on Society This study’s findings have significant implications for fostering public trust in government institutions, ultimately strengthening democracy and citizen-government relations. By understanding how e-government initiatives influence public trust, policymakers can make informed decisions to improve service delivery, enhance citizen engagement, and promote transparency, thus contributing to more resilient and accountable governance structures. Future Research Future research could opt for longitudinal studies to evaluate the long-term effects of enhancements in service quality, information quality, and security. Cross-cultural investigations can uncover universal principles and contextual differences in user experiences, supporting global e-government strategies in rural areas. Future research could also improve the research model by adding more variables, such as risk aversion or fear of job loss, to gauge individual perceptions.

ID-404,article,Acceptance of artifical intelligence systems in agriculture: the role of performance expectancy and government supports,"In the era of digitalisation, most countries worldwide are well aware of the need to develop smart-green agriculture because the negative impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly apparent on a large-scale. The application of AI in agriculture supports automation and optimisation of production processes, helping farmers increase productivity and reduce production costs. AI also allows farmers to predict and avoid climate and disease risks. Therefore, this study investigates the role of perceived usefulness on farmers’ acceptance of AI systems through the interaction with personal attitude, personal innovativeness, green and lean practices, government support, and performance expectancy. This study conducted multiple analyses to test these proposed relationships. The results found that the interactions between perceived usefulness with personal attitude, personal innovativeness, government support, and performance expectancy enhance the farmers’ acceptance of AI systems.

ID-405,article,"Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Financial Literacy: Exploring their Combined Influence on Investment Behavior among Chinese Household","The investing behavior of Chinese families is undergoing a dramatic transition in the context of the digital financial era, impacted by factors such as big data use, AI adoption, financial literacy, digital literacy, and risk aversion. Although prior research has offered useful insights into certain components, a thorough examination of their linked dynamics has been lacking. The purpose of this research was to look into how big data usage, AI adoption, financial literacy, digital literacy, and risk aversion influence investment behavior among Chinese households. Additionally, it aimed to learn more about how risk aversion and digital literacy function as mediators in these relationships. A questionnaire-based survey of 370 Chinese families was employed as part of the quantitative research methodology. The study employed AMOS to find the relationship between variables. The research found that big data usage, AI adoption, financial literacy, and digital literacy significantly and favorably influenced Chinese households' investment behavior. It was discovered that digital literacy mediated the linkages between the adoption of technology and investment decisions. Furthermore, risk aversion reduced the effects of financial literacy and big data usage on investment behavior. This study added to the body of knowledge by providing a comprehensive framework that incorporates several aspects impacting investment behavior. It shed insight into the complicated dynamics of technology uptake and literacy, as well as their impact on investment decisions. The study went beyond individual components to investigate their interactions, resulting in a more complex view of modern investment behavior. This study has broad-ranging effects that will help investors, financial institutions, governments, educators, and researchers. The focus on a particular setting and self-reported data are two important constraints that must be acknowledged. Future studies can investigate longitudinal dynamics and cross-cultural variances to further our understanding of investment behavior in the digital age. © 2024 by Author/s and Licensed by IADITI.",https://www.jisem-journal.com/download/big-data-artificial-intelligence-and-financial-literacy-exploring-their-combined-influence-on-14651.pdf,3,,,,,,"explored interactions between digital literacy, AI adoption, financial literacy, big data usage and their effect on investment decisions.

ID-410,article,How Gender and Type of Algorithmic Group Discrimination Influence Ratings of Algorithmic Decision Making,"Algorithms frequently discriminate against certain groups, and people generally reject such unfairness. However, people sometimes display an egocentric bias when choosing between fairness rules. Two online experiments were conducted to explore whether egocentric biases influence the judgment of biased algorithms. In Experiment 1, an unbiased algorithm was compared with an algorithm favoring males and an algorithm favoring married people. Experiment 2 focused only on the first two conditions. Instead of the expected gender difference in the condition in which the algorithm favored males, a gender difference in the unbiased condition was found in both experiments. Women perceived the unfair algorithm as less fair than men did. Women also perceived the algorithm favoring married people as the least fair. Fairness ratings, however, did not directly translate into permissibility ratings. The results show that egocentric biases are subtle and that women take the social context more into account than men do.

ID-412,article,Point and interval estimation: The influence of algorithmic prediction presentation on human-algorithm-integrated decision-making,"As multidomain data become increasingly measurable and available, big data-driven decision-making has emerged as a new decision-making paradigm. However, a major challenge for decision-makers is information overload due to the excessive amount of data. Redundant information interferes with the accurate analysis and assessment of relevant information. The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years provides potential solutions to this problem. AI algorithms trained on large data samples can effectively recognize patterns and make predictions in unknown situations, which facilitates decision-making. AI algorithm-assisted decision-making has been widely implemented in human resource recruitment, movie plot design, drug discovery, revenue management, and many other fields, ushering in an integrated human-AI decision-making era. How to effectively combine the complementary aspects of the two modalities to improve the joint decision-making process outcomes merits exploration. Relevant research has demonstrated that human decision-makers are often averse to algorithms. According to Daniel Kahneman, the 2002 Nobel Laureate, clinical psychologists are hostile toward and skeptical of the accuracy of algorithmic predictions. Humans tend to be less tolerant of algorithmic error than human error and avoid using algorithms in decision-making after witnessing them err. Even when algorithms outperform human decision-makers, humans still exhibit algorithm aversion and may even avoid using algorithms at the expense of efficiency. Therefore, exploring the factors that influence the acceptance of algorithms by human decision-makers and designing corresponding mechanisms to encourage the acceptance of algorithmic decisions is of great value. An element that may influence the acceptance of algorithmic decision-making by human decision-makers is the interface, which is composed of the content and information presentation, thereby affecting the joint decision outcome. Because AI predictions estimate the true value of an unknown situation, they can be presented as point estimation or interval estimation. Point estimation are often regarded as conveying more precise forecasting information, whereas interval estimates are perceived as more comprehensive but less precise. The trade-off between comprehensiveness and accuracy by decision-makers may render various information presentation formats more or less suitable;the elements that encourage algorithm advice-taking constitute the focus of our research question. This paper discusses people′s preferences for the accuracy and comprehensiveness of algorithmic predictions. This research explores the influences and underlying mechanisms of various presentation formats of algorithmic predictions on the acceptance of human decision-makers. Through a review of the relevant literature, we propose three hypotheses regarding the potential effects of using point and interval estimations to present algorithmic predictions and their underlying mechanisms. This paper presents the results of three studies involving various decision contexts undertaken to test the hypotheses, yielding the following three main findings. 1) Compared with advice presented by AI in the point estimation form, decision-makers are less willing to follow the advice of AI presented in the interval estimation form, and the degree decreases with the confidence level. 2) A heuristic is identified; that is, when the decisionmaker receives the algorithm′s prediction in the interval form and their initial decision coincides with the interval, the decision-maker tends to not adjust the initial decision. The algorithm′s suggestion will only be considered when the human decision-maker′s initial decision does not overlap with the algorithm′s prediction range. This heuristic can explain the variations in decision-makers′ adoption of point and interval estimates with varying confidence levels and indicates that decision-makers may misunderstand interval estimates. 3) Providing information to decision-makers, such as midpoints of interval estimations and explaining the meaning of distributions, can help overcome the aforementioned cognitive shortcuts. We determine that the proposed method is more beneficial to decision-makers with higher cognitive abilities or statistical knowledge, possibly because these decision-makers can better understand the given information. This study contributes to the human-algorithm-integrated decision-making literature from the perspective of information presentation formats. Our findings identify the heuristic and mitigating strategies of human-AI interactions. As the influence of AI grows in many fields, human-AI integrated decision-making will become more prevalent; therefore, this study has substantial practical implications. The method proposed in this study provides valuable guidance for influencing decision-makers′ comprehensive consideration of algorithm recommendations, thus improving the decision quality of human-algorithm-integrated decision-making.

ID-417,article,Research on the Comparative Development of Modern Popular Music and Traditional Music Culture in Colleges and Universities in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,"In this paper, the forward neural network multi-feature fusion algorithm is used to extract the emotional features of music culture on artificial intelligence technology, considering the diversity and intermittency of the emotional features of the study, which needs to be parameterized. In the forward neural network architecture, the activation value obtained by using the nonlinear activation function is used, and the results obtained are passed to the next layer of data to realize layer-by-layer forward computation, which leads to the back-propagation activation function. The music culture emotion classification model is constructed based on the propagation mode of the forward neural network to determine the emotion recognition process. The research object is selected, the research process is determined, and in order to ensure the true validity of the research, it is necessary to test the reliability and validity of the research design scheme and to develop an empirical analysis of the comparison between popular music and traditional music culture. The results show that on the model, especially in the recognition of sacred, sad, passionate emotion type of music classification accuracy reached more than 88.2%. This paper’s model can improve the classification accuracy of music emotion to a certain extent. In the ontological knowledge analysis of popular music and traditional music culture, all three editions of textbooks show that general knowledge of music is predominant and has a large proportion, appreciation knowledge and extended knowledge are also considerable, and music knowledge is the least and has a small proportion. This study demonstrates the synergistic development of traditional culture and modern popular music, which is of great significance to the development of music education in colleges and universities.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180349364&doi=10.2478%2famns.2023.2.01359&partnerID=40&md5=04f5a74d5769a6a8d15be347ef78bee2,3,,,,,,reviews advances in AI in the music domain,L Li,10.2478/amns.2023.2.01359,,1,Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180349364&doi=10.2478%2famns.2023.2.01359&partnerID=40&md5=04f5a74d5769a6a8d15be347ef78bee2,2024,,

ID-420,article,EmoBot: Artificial emotion generation through an emotional chatbot during general-purpose conversations,"Emotion modeling has always been intriguing to researchers, where detecting emotion is highly focused and generating emotion is much less focused to date. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to exploring emotion generation, particularly for general-purpose conversations. Based on the Cognitive Appraisal Theory and focusing on audio and textual inputs, we propose a novel method to calculate informative variables to evaluate a particular emotion-generating event and six primary emotions. Incorporating such a method of artificial emotion generation, we implement an emotional chatbot, namely EmoBot. Accordingly, EmoBot analyzes continuous audio and textual inputs, calculates the informative variables to evaluate the current situation, generates appropriate emotions, and responds accordingly. An objective evaluation indicates that EmoBot could generate more accurate emotional and semantic responses than a traditional chatbot that does not consider emotion. Additionally, a subjective evaluation of EmoBot demonstrates the appreciation of users for EmoBot over a traditional chatbot that does not consider emotion.",https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S138904172300102X?via%3Dihub,1,1,1,,,,Section 6 shows the results of users' subjective evaluations of EmoBot compared to a non-emotional bot,M Ehtesham-Ul-Haque and J D'Rozario and R Adnin and F T Utshaw and F Tasneem and I J Shefa and A.B.M.A. Al Islam,10.1016/j.cogsys.2023.101168,,,Cognitive Systems Research,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,83,https://www-sciencedirect-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S138904172300102X?via%3Dihub,2024,,

For a future in which radiologists use interpretive AI tools routinely in clinical practice, radiology education will need to evolve to provide radiologists with the skills to use AI appropriately and wisely. In this work, we examine how overreliance on AI may develop in radiology trainees and explore how this problem can be mitigated, including through the use of AI-augmented education. Radiology trainees will still need to develop the perceptual skills and mastery of knowledge fundamental to radiology to use AI safely. We propose a framework for radiology trainees to use AI tools with appropriate reliance, drawing on lessons from human-AI interactions research.

ID-426,article,Effect of Artificial Intelligence on Social Trust in American Institutions,"In recent decades, social scientists have debated declining levels of trust in American institutions. At the same time, many American institutions are coming under scrutiny for their use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This paper analyzes the results of a survey experiment over a nationally representative sample to gauge the effect that the use of AI has on the American public's trust in their social institutions, including government, private corporations, police precincts, and hospitals. We find that artificial intelligence systems were associated with significant trust penalties when used by American police precincts, companies, and hospitals. These penalties were especially strong for American police precincts and, in most cases, were notably stronger than the trust penalties associated with the use of smartphone apps, implicit bias training, machine learning, and mindfulness training. Americans' trust in institutions tends to be negatively impacted by the use of new tools. While there are significant variations in trust between different pairings of institutions and tools, generally speaking, institutions which use AI suffer the most significant loss of trust. American government agencies are a notable exception here, receiving a small but puzzling boost in trust when associated with the use of AI systems.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181586912&doi=10.23919%2fJSC.2023.0022&partnerID=40&md5=1348f4c535e0fcb98bc294b610d032dc,4,,,,,,paywall,A Collins and J J Jones,10.23919/JSC.2023.0022,,3,Journal of Social Computing,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,221-231,,,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181586912&doi=10.23919%2fJSC.2023.0022&partnerID=40&md5=1348f4c535e0fcb98bc294b610d032dc,2023,,

AI’s burgeoning integration into everyday life promises enhanced efficiency and innovation. The Trustworthy AI principles by the European Commission, emphasising data safeguarding, security, and judicious governance, serve as the linchpin for AI’s widespread acceptance. A correlation emerged between societal interpretations of AI’s impact and elements like trustworthiness, associated risks, and usage/acceptance. Those discerning AI’s threats often view its prospective outcomes pessimistically, while proponents recognise its transformative potential. These inclinations resonate with trust and AI’s perceived singularity. Consequently, factors such as trust, application breadth, and perceived vulnerabilities shape public consensus, depicting AI as humanity’s boon or bane.

ID-430,article,Usability of an app-based clinical decision support system to monitor psychotropic drug prescribing appropriateness in dementia,"Background: Guidelines recommend reluctant psychotropic drug (PD) prescribing in nursing home residents with dementia and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), as efficacy of PDs is limited, and side effects are common. Nevertheless, PDs are commonly prescribed to reduce NPS. A smartphone application that evaluates appropriateness of PD prescriptions and provides recommendations from the revised Dutch guideline on problem behaviour in dementia may promote guideline adherence and increase appropriate prescribing. Objective: This study aimed to assess user experiences, barriers and facilitators of the Dutch ‘Psychotropic Drug Tool’ smartphone application (PDT) in the context of appropriate prescribing of PDs to nursing home residents with dementia and NPS. Methods/design: The PDT was developed according to the recommendations of the Dutch guideline for treatment of NPS in people with dementia. Feedback provided during usability testing with two end-users was applied to improve the PDT before implementation in day-to-day practice. Sixty-three prescribers were asked to use the PDT at their own convenience for four months. User expectations and experiences were assessed at baseline and after four months with the System Usability Scale and the Assessment of Barriers and Facilitators for Implementation. Results: Expected usability (M = 72.59; SD = 11.84) was similar to experienced usability after four months (M = 69.13; SD = 16.48). Appreciation of the PDTs user-friendliness (on average 6.7 out of 10) and design (7.3) were moderately positive, in contrast to the global rating of the PDT (5.7). Perceived barriers for PDT use were time consumption and lack of integration with existing electronic systems. Perceived facilitators were ease of use and attractive lay out. For broader implementation, physicians suggested a change in direction of the PDT: start assessment of appropriateness based on the list of NPS instead of PD as primary input. Conclusions: In this pragmatic prospective cohort study we found that the PDT was used by elderly care physicians, with mediocre user satisfaction. The PDT will be optimized based on user feedback regarding experienced usability, barriers and facilitators, after which broader implementation can be initialized.

ID-432,article,Unpacking Human and AI Complementarity: Insights from Recent Works,"In this editorial, we draw insights from recent empirical studies to answer some key questions related to human and AI complementarity. There is consensus regarding the strengths of machine intelligence in performing structured and codifiable tasks and complementing two human limitations: lack of consistency and inability to unlearn conventional wisdom. To work effectively with AI, humans need to possess not only AI skills but also domain expertise, job skills, and metaknowledge to accurately assess human capabilities and AI capabilities. We identify several future directions in understanding the effects of human expertise and experiences on algorithmic appreciation, the mutual learning and adaptions between humans and AI, and the boundary conditions of effective human and AI complementarity.

ID-433,article,Applied artificial intelligence: Acceptance-intention-purchase and satisfaction on smartwatch usage in a Ghanaian context,"Technology and its continuous advancement facilitate human beings to get rid of their criticality and limitation. Applied artificial intelligence (AAI) is one of the latest forms that delimited the limitation of human beings. Smartwatch acts as an applied artificial intelligence to assist various patients to check medical care without going to hospital and physicians. This (three) multiple-study research focused on the intention to use, purchase, and their satisfaction and spread positive word of mouth among others in the Ghanaian. To investigate these issues two renowned theories were underpinned- TAM theory and the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S–O-R). Total 550, 320, and 170 respondents were interviewed with Google forms due to COVID-19 using social media. AI-enabled smartwatch considering Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Credibility (PC), Perceived Self-Efficacy (PSE), and Perceived Financial Cost (PFC) were significant on intention to adoption and adoption intention on actual purchase. The final study showed device quality, its service level, their usage experience, perceived value, and the extent to which the satisfied customers made positive word of mouth to their friends and family, colleagues and followers. This research is significant in understanding the usage of AI-enabled smartwatches as a device doctor or electronic doctor (e-doctor).

ID-437,article,Appreciation vs. apology: Research on the influence mechanism of chatbot service recovery based on politeness theory,"Failures in human-chatbot interactions are becoming inevitable such as failure of chatbots to maintain contextual awareness. Thus, an effective service recovery strategy is essential for e-commerce enterprises to restore customers and resolve their complaints. Therefore, based on politeness theory, this study explores the fundamental mechanism and boundary conditions for a chatbot politeness strategy (appreciation vs. apology) on consumers' post-recovery satisfaction using four scenario-based experiments. The results indicate that establishing a good human-chatbot relationship (appreciation) is a more effective recovery strategy than admitting the chatbot's limited competence (apology) in redressing service failures; face concern mediates the effect of the politeness strategy on post-recovery satisfaction; and time pressure plays a moderating role in the effect of the politeness strategy on face concern and post-recovery satisfaction. This study extends the research of politeness theory and face concern in the field of chatbot marketing, and provide practical guidance for e-commerce enterprises to deal effectively with chatbot failure.

ID-443,article,BCI-based hit-loop agent for human and AI robot co-learning with AIoT application,"In this paper, we propose a brain–computer interface (BCI)-based Human-in-the-Loop (Hit-Loop) agent for human and artificial intelligence (AI) colearning in music listening and appreciation with an Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) application. The novel BCI-based Hit-Loop agent contains human intelligence with BCI-based AIoT-Fuzzy Markup Language (FML) and BCI-FML agents, as well as machine intelligence with AI-FML Hit-Loop and AIoT-FML agents. We used FML to facilitate communication between humans and the AI-FML robots through an AIoT-FML Learning Tool (AIoT-FML-LT), which was the core technology of the AI-FML Hit-Loop agent for the BCI-based music listening and appreciation application. Furthermore, the novel AIoT-FML-LT in conjunction with the BCI-FML and AIoT-FML agents was developed and presented for music listening and student learning. Moreover, the BCI-based AIoT-FML and AI-FML Hit-Loop agents were applied in English language learning, and the AIoT-FML-LT assisted in measuring student learning performance in Taiwan and Japan. The human-like high-level knowledge base and rule base were constructed by various domain experts, as well as the personalized electroencephalography (EEG) and student English learning data sets collected using the BCI device and AIoT-FML-LT, respectively, and were applied to machine learning models such as deep learning and particle swarm optimization. Additionally, the AIoT-FML-LT was connected to the AIoT-FML Hit-Loop agent for human and robot colearning. The relationship between human perceptions and the AIoT-FML Hit-Loop agent in terms of eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and brain corresponding to sights, sounds, smells, tastes, objects of touch, and mind are discussed. Finally, the students learned human language and AI language by using the AI-FML robots and AIoT-FML-LT together with the human English learning and AI-FML machine learning models, respectively. The experimental results reveal that the BCI-based Hit-Loop agent for human and AI-FML robot colearning in conjunction with AIoT applications can effectively facilitate music listening and appreciation application as well as English listening in Taiwan and Japan.

ID-444,article,Human-AI Interactions in Public Sector Decision Making: “Automation Bias” and “Selective Adherence” to Algorithmic Advice,"Artificial intelligence algorithms are increasingly adopted as decisional aides by public bodies, with the promise of overcoming biases of human decision-makers. At the same time, they may introduce new biases in the human-algorithm interaction. Drawing on psychology and public administration literatures, we investigate two key biases: overreliance on algorithmic advice even in the face of “warning signals” from other sources (automation bias), and selective adoption of algorithmic advice when this corresponds to stereotypes (selective adherence). We assess these via three experimental studies conducted in the Netherlands: In study 1 (N = 605), we test automation bias by exploring participants' adherence to an algorithmic prediction compared to an equivalent human-expert prediction. We do not find evidence for automation bias. In study 2 (N = 904), we replicate these findings, and also test selective adherence. We find a stronger propensity for adherence when the advice is aligned with group stereotypes, with no significant differences between algorithmic and human-expert advice. In study 3 (N = 1,345), we replicate our design with a sample of civil servants. This study was conducted shortly after a major scandal involving public authorities' reliance on an algorithm with discriminatory outcomes (the “childcare benefits scandal”). The scandal is itself illustrative of our theory and patterns diagnosed empirically in our experiment, yet in our study 3, while supporting our prior findings as to automation bias, we do not find patterns of selective adherence. We suggest this is driven by bureaucrats' enhanced awareness of discrimination and algorithmic biases in the aftermath of the scandal. We discuss the implications of our findings for public sector decision making in the age of automation. Overall, our study speaks to potential negative effects of automation of the administrative state for already vulnerable and disadvantaged citizens.",https://content.ebscohost.com/cds/retrieve?content=AQICAHiylJ_bvOB56hI8UzTN6Ryruh7a0kiIBN_ANwtaWYjmxwH68UsVoqohxzlRTnqL8XYEAAAA4zCB4AYJKoZIhvcNAQcGoIHSMIHPAgEAMIHJBgkqhkiG9w0BBwEwHgYJYIZIAWUDBAEuMBEEDI9FmU6IICPGtllESgIBEICBm5SY442gpp_ZfQsLSWFh2u5eWytBkbYRcwibKwPSCJrw3KX_XQ0lDDPVWSt33hc8jLXDmDWB1XGYB4P418GHH6rOPWGEtJ7nvQ_q5qUiEGI_dB4bcuvV8gnZgxEWCLuVFgEHKPoWoQC5C8KtoZxbA3RCBvMAJx4cwWIA6r4daPI4tU5bMJoDU4BaqKiNuD-AK7EV-vJWOI45eXoS,1,1,1,HR evaluation of teacher,PS randomly assigned to human evaluator or machine learning algorithm evaluator.

This paper provides a perspective of step counting in wearable technology, identifying some limitations to the ways in which wearable technology measures steps and indicating caution in current uses of step counting as a proxy for physical activity. Based on an overview of the current state of the art of technologies and approaches to step counting in digital wearable technologies, we discuss limitations that are methodological as well as epistemic and ethical—limitations to the use of step counting as a basis to build scientific knowledge on physical activity (epistemic limitations) as well as limitations to the accessibility and representativity of these tools (ethical limitations). As such, using step counting as a proxy for physical activity should be considered a form of reductionism. This is not per se problematic, but there is a need for critical appreciation and awareness of the limitations of reductionistic approaches.

ID-449,article,Exploring moral algorithm preferences in autonomous vehicle dilemmas: an empirical study,"Introduction: This study delves into the ethical dimensions surrounding autonomous vehicles (AVs), with a specific focus on decision-making algorithms. Termed the “Trolley problem,” an ethical quandary arises, necessitating the formulation of moral algorithms grounded in ethical principles. To address this issue, an online survey was conducted with 460 participants in China, comprising 237 females and 223 males, spanning ages 18 to 70. Methods: Adapted from Joshua Greene’s trolley dilemma survey, our study employed Yes/No options to probe participants’ choices and Likert scales to gauge moral acceptance. The primary objective was to assess participants’ inclinations toward four distinct algorithmic strategies—Utilitarianism, Rawlsianism, Egoism, and a Hybrid approach—in scenarios involving AVs Results: Our findings revealed a significant disparity between participants’ preferences in scenarios related to AV design and those focused on purchase decisions. Notably, over half of the respondents expressed reluctance to purchase AVs equipped with an “egoism” algorithm, which prioritizes the car owner’s safety. Intriguingly, the rejection rate for “egoism” was similar to that of “utilitarianism,” which may necessitate self-sacrifice. Discussion: The hybrid approach, integrating “Utilitarianism” and “Egoism,” garnered the highest endorsement. This highlights the importance of balancing self-sacrifice and harm minimization in AV moral algorithms. The study’s insights are crucial for ethically and practically advancing AV technology in the continually evolving realm of autonomous vehicles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10713701/,1,1,1,self-driving cars,,,"compared four different moral algorithms: utilitarian, rawlsian, egoist, hybrid. utilitarian = sacrifice the few to save the many; rawlsian = minimize maximum fatality rate by calculating death rates of car owner vs. other people; egoist = prioritize the safety of the driver; hybrid = utilitiarian + egoist (different priorities depending on the driving scenario)",T Sui,10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1229245,,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,Cited By :1,,,,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179336829&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2023.1229245&partnerID=40&md5=07676216eac475c1dd4ec44eb92d9cfd,2023,,

ID-452,article,Content Analysis of Judges’ Sentiments Toward Artificial Intelligence Risk Assessment Tools,"Artificial intelligence (AI) uses computer programming to make predictions (e.g., bail decisions) and has the potential to benefit the justice system (e.g., save time and reduce bias). This secondary data analysis assessed 381 judges’ responses to the question, “Do you feel that artificial intelligence (using computer programs and algorithms) holds promise to remove bias from bail and sentencing decisions?” The authors created apriori themes based on the literature, which included judges’ algorithm aversion and appreciation, locus of control, procedural justice, and legitimacy. Results suggest that judges experience algorithm aversion, have significant concerns about bias being exacerbated by AI, and worry about being replaced by computers. Judges believe that AI has the potential to inform their decisions about bail and sentencing; however, it must be empirically tested and follow guidelines. Using the data gathered about judges’ sentiments toward AI, we discuss the integration of AI into the legal system and future research.

ID-454,article,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) ADOPTION: AN EXTENDED COMPENSATORY LEVEL OF ACCEPTANCE,"This paper uses a new measurement of AI’s intelligence related to task performance to examine how expectations about the operating efficiency of an AI technology influence the intention to adopt it. We suggest four levels of user acceptance/rejection of AI services, including the level of compensatory acceptance. Our conceptual model is specifically designed for the AI context, with two key variables: cybersecurity and anthropomorphism, and three mediating constructs: i) perceived level of AI’s intelligence, ii) perceived performance expectancy, and iii) perceived effort expectancy. The hypotheses were tested by surveying 494 potential virtual banking users in Hong Kong and analyzing the data with Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). We find that consumer acceptance of AI services is positively related to perceived performance expectancy and effort expectancy and to the perceived level of AI’s intelligence. These findings support an extended behavioral intention: the compensatory level of AI acceptance.

ID-456,article,Investigating the negative bias towards artificial intelligence: Effects of prior assignment of AI-authorship on the aesthetic appreciation of abstract paintings,"Art, regarded as one of the last bulwarks of human prerogatives, is a valid model for investigating the relationship between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent studies investigated the response to human-made vs. AI-made artworks, reporting evidence of either a negative bias towards the latter or no difference. Here, we investigated whether prior knowledge of authorship can influence the aesthetic appreciation of two abstract paintings by manipulating the pre-assignment of human- vs. AI-authorship. In the ecological setting of an art fair, participants were asked to explicitly rate their aesthetic appreciation, while psychophysiological measure - electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR) - were recorded during the observation of the two paintings. Presentation order was balanced among participants and artworks. Results show that when the human-declared painting was shown as first, aesthetic judgement on the AI-declared painting were lower, while with the opposite presentation order judgements were equal. Furthermore, although no modulation of HR was found, EDA activation was always higher during the second presentation. In line with literature, the results showed that looking at abstract artworks reduces the negative bias towards AI. However, the negative bias still emerges when AI-artworks are implicitly compared to human-artworks.

ID-459,article,Why do users trust algorithms? A review and conceptualization of initial trust and trust over time,"Algorithms are increasingly playing a pivotal role in organizations' day-to-day operations; however, a general distrust of artificial intelligence-based algorithms and automated processes persists. This aversion to algorithms raises questions about the drivers that lead managers to trust or reject their use. This conceptual paper aims to provide an integrated review of how users experience the encounter with AI-based algorithms over time. This is important for two reasons: first, their functional activities change over the course of time through machine learning; and second, users' trust develops with their level of knowledge of a particular algorithm. Based on our review, we propose an integrative framework to explain how users’ perceptions of trust change over time. This framework extends current understandings of trust in AI-based algorithms in two areas: First, it distinguishes between the formation of initial trust and trust over time in AI-based algorithms, and specifies the determinants of trust in each phase. Second, it links the transition between initial trust in AI-based algorithms and trust over time to representations of the technology as either human-like or system-like. Finally, it considers the additional determinants that intervene during this transition phase. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263237322000846?via%3Dihub,1,3,2,,"anthropomorphism (benevolence, competence, integrity)",,"also considered user characteristics like propensity to trust, peer influences",F Cabiddu and L Moi and G Patriotta and D G Allen,10.1016/j.emj.2022.06.001,,5,European Management Journal,,,Cited By :21,685-706,,,40,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132817022&doi=10.1016%2fj.emj.2022.06.001&partnerID=40&md5=615b8ed70de686fd05f2ed89c07d3e5e,2022,,
ID-460,article,Artificial intelligence in public services: When and why citizens accept its usage,"Interest in implementing artificial intelligence (AI)–based software in the public sector is growing. First implementations and research in individual public services have already been carried out; however, a better understanding of citizens' acceptance of this technology is missing in the public sector, as insights from the private sector cannot be transferred directly. For this purpose, we conduct policy-capturing experiments to analyze AI's acceptance in six representative scenarios. Based on behavioral reasoning theory, we gather evidence from 329 participants. The results show that AI solutions in general public services are preferred over those provided by humans, but specific services are still a human domain. Further analyses show that the major drivers toward acceptance are the reasons against AI. The results contribute to understanding of when and why AI is accepted in public services. Public administration can use the results to identify AI-based software to invest in and communicate their usage to perceive such investments' high acceptance rates. © 2022 The Authors",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X22000375,1,1,1,"public services:  (1) specific administration, social, and education: exhibition; (2) specific security and health: life-threatening disease; (3) specific infrastructure: waste management; (4) general administration, social, and education: youth aid in hot spots; (5) general security and health: bushfires; and (6) general infrastructure: bridge",,,,T S Gesk and M Leyer,doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2022.101704,,3,Government Information Quarterly,,,Cited By :39,,,,39,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127463083&doi=10.1016%2fj.giq.2022.101704&partnerID=40&md5=f2252d57e3fb2ab79b44200686af9486,2022,,
ID-461,article,Reasoned A(I)dministration: Explanation Requirements in EU Law and the Automation of Public Administration,"Mechanisms to control public power have been developed and shaped around human beings as decision-makers at the centre of the public administration. However, technology is radically changing how public administration is organised and reliance on Artificial Intelligence is on the rise across all sectors. While carrying the promise of an increasingly efficient administration, automating (parts of) administrative decision-making processes also poses a challenge to our human-centred systems of control of public power. This article focuses on one of these control mechanisms: the duty to give reasons under EU law, a pillar of administrative law designed to enable individuals to challenge decisions and courts to exercise their powers of review. First, it analyses whether the duty to give reasons can be meaningfully applied when EU bodies rely on AI systems to inform their decision-making. Secondly, it examines the added value of secondary law, in particular the data protection rules applicable to EU institutions and the draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act, in complementing and adapting the duty to give reasons to better fulfil its purpose in a (partially) automated administration. This article concludes that the duty to give reasons provides a useful starting point but leaves a number of aspects unclear. While providing important safeguards, neither EU data protection law nor the draft EU Artificial Intelligence Act currently fill these gaps.

ID-465,article,Adolescents’ Algorithmic Resistance to Short Video APP’s Recommendation: The Dual Mediating Role of Resistance Willingness and Resistance Intention,"Adolescents have gradually become a vital group of interacting with social media recommendation algorithms. Although numerous studies have been conducted to investigate negative reactions (both psychological and behavioral reactance) that the dark side of recommendation algorithms brings to social media users, little is known about the resistance intention and behavior based on their agency in the daily process of encountering algorithms. Focusing on the concept of algorithm resistance, this study used a two-path model (distinguishing resistance willingness and resistance intention) to investigate the algorithmic resistance of rural Chinese adolescents (N = 905) in their daily use of short video apps. The findings revealed that the perceived threat to freedom, algorithmic literacy, and peer influence were positively associated with the resistance willingness and intention; while the independent psychology on algorithmic recommendations significantly weakened resistance willingness and intention. Furthermore, this study verified the mediating role of resistance willingness and intention between the above independent variables and resistance behavior. Additionally, the positive impact of resistance willingness on resistance intention was confirmed.

ID-468,article,People Prefer Moral Discretion to Algorithms: Algorithm Aversion Beyond Intransparency,"We explore aversion to the use of algorithms in moral decision-making. So far, this aversion has been explained mainly by the fear of opaque decisions that are potentially biased. Using incentivized experiments, we study which role the desire for human discretion in moral decision-making plays. This seems justified in light of evidence suggesting that people might not doubt the quality of algorithmic decisions, but still reject them. In our first study, we found that people prefer humans with decision-making discretion to algorithms that rigidly apply exogenously given human-created fairness principles to specific cases. In the second study, we found that people do not prefer humans to algorithms because they appreciate flesh-and-blood decision-makers per se, but because they appreciate humans’ freedom to transcend fairness principles at will. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of algorithm aversion. They indicate that emphasizing the transparency of algorithms that clearly follow fairness principles might not be the only element for fostering societal algorithm acceptance and suggest reconsidering certain features of the decision-making process. © 2022, The Author(s).",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-021-00495-y?utm_source=getftr&utm_medium=getftr&utm_campaign=getftr_pilot,1,1,1,,"empathy, moral discretion/autonomy (ability to override a fairness principle in the case of an exception that requires human empathy)",,Is there more to algorithm aversion than a fear of opacity?

ID-469,article,AI invading the workplace: negative emotions towards the organizational use of personal virtual assistants,"Personal virtual assistants (PVAs) based on artificial intelligence are frequently used in private contexts but have yet to find their way into the workplace. Regardless of their potential value for organizations, the relentless implementation of PVAs at the workplace is likely to run into employee resistance. To understand what motivates such resistance, it is necessary to investigate the primary motivators of human behavior, namely emotions. This paper uncovers emotions related to organizational PVA use, primarily focusing on threat emotions. To achieve our goal, we conducted an in-depth qualitative study, collecting data from 45 employees in focus-group discussions and individual interviews. We identified and categorized emotions according to the framework for classifying emotions Beaudry and Pinsonneault (2010) designed. Our results show that loss emotions, such as dissatisfaction and frustration, as well as deterrence emotions, such as fear and worry, constitute valuable cornerstones for the boundaries of organizational PVA use. © 2021, The Author(s).",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-021-00493-0?utm_source=getftr&utm_medium=getftr&utm_campaign=getftr_pilot,1,2,2,personal virtual assistants in the workplace,,,"focus groups, qualitative data. appraisal of virtual assistance can be conceptualized in terms of threat vs. opportunity and perceived sense of control, resulting in different emotions.

ID-471,article,Examining perceptions towards hiring algorithms,"Companies are increasingly turning to AI software to select candidates, despite concerns that hiring algorithms may produce biased evaluations. This study explores the public perceptions of algorithms used in resume and video interview screening. In addition, the effects of individual characteristics on these perceptions are examined. Using a nationally representative sample, we find that the public generally has a negative attitude towards the use of algorithms in hiring, and the majority do not consider them fair and effective. We also find clear individual differences regarding the perceptions towards algorithms. Specifically, males, people with higher education level and people with higher income have more positive perceptions towards hiring algorithms than their counterparts. The findings contribute to the emerging body of research on hiring algorithms and suggest strategies to increase public acceptance of hiring algorithms. © 2022",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21003237?via%3Dihub,1,1,1,recruiting,"fairness, effectiveness",,,L Zhang and C Yencha,10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101848,,,Technology in Society,,,Cited By :18,,,,68,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122190388&doi=10.1016%2fj.techsoc.2021.101848&partnerID=40&md5=1d4f4647c1e83e1764fd96360bdbf547,2022,,

ID-476,article,Analysis of Painting Elements of Tea Culture and Art Works Based on Image Perception,"The art works take tea as the theme of painting elements, and depict the content of Chinese traditional culture by showing the connotation of tea culture painting elements. For example, Wen Zhiming, a painter and calligrapher in Ming Dynasty, is best at painting landscape figures. He often uses tea as the theme in his art works, adding the elegant, natural, and simple painting elements of tea into his works, and has created many famous art works that are spread around the world. In recent years, with the deepening of the research on image processing technology, image perception technology has attracted more and more researchers' attention, which has made great achievements and progress in image perception algorithms. This paper studies the tea culture elements of art works based on image perception algorithm. The accuracy of similar image pairs is the ratio that similar image pairs are correctly recognized. When the number of experiments reaches 25, the image sensing algorithm in this paper has the highest accuracy rate, with the accuracy rate of 99.8%, when the number of experiments reaches 20, the ant colony algorithm with the accuracy rate of 96.5%, when the number of experiments reaches 20, and finally the artificial intelligence algorithm with the accuracy rate of 96.0%. The correct rate of similar image pairs is the correct recognition rate of tampered image pairs. When the number of experiments reaches 10 times, the correct rate of image perception algorithm in this paper still ranks first, with the correct rate of 99.8%, when the number of experiments reaches 25 times, the artificial intelligence algorithm with the correct rate of 98.2%, and finally when the number of experiments reaches 10 times, the ant colony algorithm with the correct rate of 96.2%. It can be seen that the numerical values in this column show the robustness of this algorithm. Through the cultivation of students' image perception ability, it can promote students' appreciation ability of tea culture painting elements, learn the knowledge of tea culture painting elements beauty in a deeper level, master the skills of beauty, and improve their artistic temperament and artistic accomplishment. © 2022 Haiting Zhao.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135005986&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f2439464&partnerID=40&md5=e6bca0d3a0739dfa564a971acba5c4ae,3,,,,,,,H Zhao,10.1155/2022/2439464,,,Security and Communication Networks,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135005986&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f2439464&partnerID=40&md5=e6bca0d3a0739dfa564a971acba5c4ae,2022,,
ID-477,article,Algorithmic versus Human Advice: Does Presenting Prediction Performance Matter for Algorithm Appreciation?,"We propose a theoretical model based on the judge-advisor system (JAS) and empirically examine how algorithmic advice, compared to identical advice from humans, influences human judgment. This effect is contingent on the level of transparency, which varies with whether and how the prediction performance of the advice source is presented. In a series of five controlled behavioral experiments, we show that individuals largely exhibit algorithm appreciation; that is, they follow algorithmic advice to a greater extent than identical human advice due to a higher trust in an algorithmic than human advisor. Interestingly, neither the extent of higher trust in algorithmic advisors nor the level of algorithm appreciation decreases when individuals are informed of the algorithm’s prediction errors (i.e., upon presenting prediction performance in an aggregated format). By contrast, algorithm appreciation declines when the transparency of the advice source’s prediction performance further increases through an elaborated format. This is plausibly because the greater cognitive load imposed by the elaborated format impedes advice taking. Finally, we identify a boundary condition: algorithm appreciation is reduced for individuals with a lower dispositional need for cognition. Our findings provide key implications for research and managerial practice. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",https://content.ebscohost.com/cds/retrieve?content=AQICAHiylJ_bvOB56hI8UzTN6Ryruh7a0kiIBN_ANwtaWYjmxwHnjlgOIar36sj-nFfaFVTKAAAA4zCB4AYJKoZIhvcNAQcGoIHSMIHPAgEAMIHJBgkqhkiG9w0BBwEwHgYJYIZIAWUDBAEuMBEEDLpFqLdwctpCv_9wkQIBEICBm4VBKoo48peciUVJa2LhnAO2cvvW6E-i5fSTZac9wdmgutN6oR3W-ma__udfROfLnjFAeAq3qZkYtU-BT53HQpcrawRAvweh8grJfbcs6JOETiVHorLr9K0kqb7xMYrOf4GWqO7ylzS8DqkigGIq82DNA3MqPAMyy92ETIqKtdORjGcrglIbo4C1tgsxwe4IOi4P1OXDy15PKkSs,1,1,1,predictions,transparency,,"WOA to measure algorithm appreciation; transparency as a predictor of trust, which predicts algorithm appreciation.

In this study, we propose and empirically demonstrate that perceived ease of use, self-efficacy, perceived management support, and digitalization are positively related to salespeople’s acceptance of AI. Moreover, we show that digitalization mediates the relationship between salespeople’s prospecting/adaptive selling capabilities and their AI acceptance. The results suggest that in order to incentivize AI acceptance, managers need to build adequate digital infrastructure, cultivate organizational support to encourage AI adoption and usage, provide professional training to educate salespeople on the proper usage of AI, and reduce salespeople’s perceived risk of AI usage.

ID-481,article,Persuasive robots should avoid authority: The effects of formal and real authority on persuasion in human-robot interaction,"Social robots must take on many roles when interacting with people in everyday settings, some of which may be authoritative, such as a nurse, teacher, or guard. It is important to investigate whether and how authoritative robots can influence people in applications ranging from health care and education to security and in the home. Here, we present a human-robot interaction study that directly investigates the effect of a robot's peer or authority role (formal authority) and control of monetary rewards and penalties (real authority) on its persuasive influence. The study consisted of a social robot attempting to persuade people to change their answers to the robot's suggestion in a series of challenging attention and memory tasks. Our results show that the robot in a peer role was more persuasive than when in an authority role, contrary to expectations from human-human interactions. The robot was also more persuasive when it offered rewards over penalties, suggesting that participants perceived the robot's suggestions as a less risky option than their own estimates, in line with prospect theory. In general, the results show an aversion to the persuasive influence of authoritative robots, potentially due to the robot's legitimacy as an authority figure, its behavior being perceived as dominant, or participant feelings of threatened autonomy. This paper explores the importance of persuasion for robots in different social roles while providing critical insight into the perception of robots in these roles, people's behavior around these robots, and the development of human-robot relationships. © 2021 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

ID-489,article,The most human bot: Female gendering increases humanness perceptions of bots and acceptance of AI,"Companies have repeatedly launched Artificial Intelligence (AI) products such as intelligent chatbots and robots with female names, voices, and bodies. Previous research posits that people intuitively favor female over male bots, mainly because female bots are judged as warmer and more likely to experience emotions. We present five online studies, including four preregistered, with a total sample of over 3,000 participants that go beyond this longstanding perception of femininity. Because warmth and experience (but not competence) are seen as fundamental qualities to be a full human but are lacking in machines, we argue that people prefer female bots because they are perceived as more human than male bots. Using implicit, subtle, and blatant scales of humanness, our results consistently show that women (Studies 1A and 1B), female bots (Studies 2 and 3), and female chatbots (Study 4) are perceived as more human than their male counterparts when compared with non-human entities (animals and machines). Study 4 investigates explicitly the acceptance of gendered algorithms operated by AI chatbots in a health context. We found that the female chatbot is preferred over the male chatbot because it is perceived as more human and more likely to consider our unique needs. These results highlight the ethical quandary faced by AI designers and policymakers: Women are said to be transformed into objects in AI, but injecting women's humanity into AI objects makes these objects seem more human and acceptable. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",https://content.ebscohost.com/cds/retrieve?content=AQICAHiylJ_bvOB56hI8UzTN6Ryruh7a0kiIBN_ANwtaWYjmxwG0p2ExQD8alRwUQDhMmWorAAAA4zCB4AYJKoZIhvcNAQcGoIHSMIHPAgEAMIHJBgkqhkiG9w0BBwEwHgYJYIZIAWUDBAEuMBEEDFA5iVeLpYp7AIHH-QIBEICBm78q9R831nm2Z93Q_icsCa5Y64a546w6DaxazaElGEXF2o7wV7gKDkIy9b4CGXU7RfHslVpFgNiFtJmxK1REUlz2MdP7toVtovCUsLPFoIyrq7YztAZ6vpy_LTO3-XpNoAh9Y2XFb5yLbz3kPgyzGZi_jmdmRr5-C_KZydNhTWZd_eBSxVBHM4y7L8XCpKkJ4wkusDFR6H4HZQqO,1,1,1,,perceived humanness,,"chatbots and robots with female presentations are seen as more human-like because they are judged as warmer and more likely to experience emotions.

ID-491,article,Explainable artificial intelligence: a global fast approach,"Decisions in the financial industry place ever-increasing reliance on artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms. These decisions span entire business lines and value chains, including customer marketing, credit underwriting, financial and capital planning, algorithmic trading and automated interaction with customers, particularly chatbots and robo-advice. The most advanced algorithms, however, are complex and inherently opaque, as they require up to hundreds of inputs, which then undergo several layers of processing that are not transparent. Such complexity and opacity raise the need for explainable AI (XAI) to understand how these algorithms produce a specific output and how they work in general. Local explain capability identifies the key determinants of a specific output while global explain capability identifies the inputs that have the highest impact on the output for the algorithm as a whole. In particular, global explain capability such as the Shapley value with computational complexity of N! is prohibitively expensive with currently available approaches. This paper presents model-agnostic approaches that provide local explain capability through counterfactuals and, most importantly, global fast explanation capability. © Henry Stewart Publications.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111243777&partnerID=40&md5=d0290bea5e8c2e3d79cf33106f5ca1a1,3,,,,,,,D Mayenberger,,,3,Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions,,,Cited By :1,287-300,,,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111243777&partnerID=40&md5=d0290bea5e8c2e3d79cf33106f5ca1a1,2021,,
ID-492,article,Clinical integration of machine learning for curative-intent radiation treatment of patients with prostate cancer,"Machine learning (ML) holds great promise for impacting healthcare delivery; however, to date most methods are tested in ‘simulated’ environments that cannot recapitulate factors influencing real-world clinical practice. We prospectively deployed and evaluated a random forest algorithm for therapeutic curative-intent radiation therapy (RT) treatment planning for prostate cancer in a blinded, head-to-head study with full integration into the clinical workflow. ML- and human-generated RT treatment plans were directly compared in a retrospective simulation with retesting (n = 50) and a prospective clinical deployment (n = 50) phase. Consistently throughout the study phases, treating physicians assessed ML- and human-generated RT treatment plans in a blinded manner following a priori defined standardized criteria and peer review processes, with the selected RT plan in the prospective phase delivered for patient treatment. Overall, 89% of ML-generated RT plans were considered clinically acceptable and 72% were selected over human-generated RT plans in head-to-head comparisons. RT planning using ML reduced the median time required for the entire RT planning process by 60.1% (118 to 47 h). While ML RT plan acceptability remained stable between the simulation and deployment phases (92 versus 86%), the number of ML RT plans selected for treatment was significantly reduced (83 versus 61%, respectively). These findings highlight that retrospective or simulated evaluation of ML methods, even under expert blinded review, may not be representative of algorithm acceptance in a real-world clinical setting when patient care is at stake. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01359-w,1,1,1,medical,,"compared actual human-generated vs. ML-generated treatment plans.

ID-494,article,How safe is safe enough? Psychological mechanisms underlying extreme safety demands for self-driving cars,"Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) promise of a multi-trillion-dollar industry that revolutionizes transportation safety and convenience depends as much on overcoming the psychological barriers to their widespread use as the technological and legal challenges. The first AV-related traffic fatalities have pushed manufacturers and regulators towards decisions about how mature AV technology should be before the cars are rolled out in large numbers. We discuss the psychological factors underlying the question of how safe AVs need to be to compel consumers away from relying on the abilities of human drivers. For consumers, how safe is safe enough? Three preregistered studies (N = 4566) reveal that the established psychological biases of algorithm aversion and the better-than-average effect leave consumers averse to adopting AVs unless the cars meet extremely potentially unrealistically high safety standards. Moreover, these biases prove stubbornly hard to overcome, and risk substantially delaying the adoption of life-saving autonomous driving technology. We end by proposing that, from a psychological perspective, the emphasis AV advocates have put on safety may be misplaced. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X21000942?via%3Dihub,4,,,self-driving cars,,,paywall.

ID-495,article,Privacy and Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing field of research with many practical applications. Congruent to advances in technologies that enable big data, deep learning, and neural networks to train, learn, and predict, artificial intelligence creates new risks that are difficult to predict and manage. Such risks include economic turmoil, existential crises, and the dissolution of individual privacy. If unchecked, the capabilities of artificially intelligent systems could pose a fundamental threat to privacy in their operation or these systems may leak information under adversarial conditions. In this article, we survey the literature and provide various scenarios for the use of artificial intelligence, highlighting potential risks to privacy and offering various mitigating strategies. For the purpose of this research, a North American perspective of privacy is adopted. Impact statement—While an appreciation of the privacy risks associated with artificial intelligence is important, a thorough understanding of the assortment of different technologies that comprise artificial intelligence better prepares those implementing such systems in assessing privacy impacts. This can be achieved through the independent consideration of each constituent of an artificially intelligent system and its interactions. Under individual consideration, privacy-enhancing tools can be applied in a targeted manner to reduce the risk associated with specific components of an artificially intelligent system. A generalized North American approach to assess privacy risks in such systems is proposed that will retain applicability as the field of research evolves and can be adapted to account for various sociopolitical influences. With such an approach, privacy risks in artificial intelligent systems can be well understood, measured, and reduced. © 2021 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119897706&doi=10.1109%2fTAI.2021.3088084&partnerID=40&md5=d481bacf8af4723bb07949c59785fb77,3,,,,,,,J Curzon and T Ann Kosa and R Akalu and K El-Khatib,10.1109/TAI.2021.3088084,,2,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,,,Cited By :22,96-108,,,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119897706&doi=10.1109%2fTAI.2021.3088084&partnerID=40&md5=d481bacf8af4723bb07949c59785fb77,2021,,
ID-496,article,The cognition of audience to artistic style transfer,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more popular in various fields, including the area of art creation. Advances in AI technology bring new opportunities and challenges in the creation, experience, and appreciation of art. The neural style transfer (NST) realizes the intelligent conversion of any artistic style using neural networks. However, the artistic style is the product of cognition that involving from visual to feel. The purpose of this paper is to study factors affecting audience cognitive difference and preference on artistic style transfer. Those factors are discussed to investigate the application of the AI generator model in art creation. Therefore, based on the artist’s encoding attributes (color, stroke, texture) and the audience’s decoding cognitive levels (technical, semantic, effectiveness), this study proposed a framework to evaluate artistic style transfer in the perspective of cognition. Thirty-one subjects with a background in art, aesthetics, and design were recruited to participate in the experiment. The experimental process consists of four style groups, including Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, and Renaissance. According to the finding in this study, participants can still recognize different artistic styles after transferred by neural networks. Besides, the features of texture and stroke are more impact on the perception of fitness than color. The audience may prefer the samples with high cognition in the semantic and effectiveness levels. The above indicates that through AI automated routine work, the cognition of the audience to artistic style still can be kept and transferred.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/7/3290,3,,,,,,,Y Lyu and C.-L.

ID-497,article,When will workers follow an algorithm? A field experiment with a retail business,"This paper develops a new algorithm for increasing the revenue in a dynamic product assortment problem. Then, it identifies the challenges faced by managers in practice and discusses the conditions under which workers follow the algorithm. To do so, I conducted a field experiment with a beverage vending machine business. The experiment shows that, on average, workers are reluctant to follow the algorithmic advice; however, the workers are more willing to conform once their forecasts are integrated into the algorithm. Analyses using nonexperimental variations highlight the importance of taking worker and context heterogeneity into account to maximize the benefit from adopting a new algorithm. Higher worker’s regret, sales volatility, and fewer delegations increase the conformity, while they mitigate the effects of integration. Workers avoid high-traffic vending machines and focus on machines with high sales volatility when adopting the algorithm. The effects on the sales are largely similar to the effects on product assortments. The results emphasize the gap between nominal and actual performance of an algorithm and several practical issues to be resolved.

ID-499,article,Two distinct and separable processes underlie individual differences in algorithm adherence: Differences in predictions and differences in trust thresholds,"Algorithms play an increasingly ubiquitous and vitally important role in modern society. However, recent findings suggest substantial individual variability in the degree to which people make use of such algorithmic systems, with some users preferring the advice of algorithms whereas others selectively avoid algorithmic systems. The mechanisms that give rise to these individual differences are currently poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested two possible effects that may underlie this variability: users may differ in their predictions of the efficacy of algorithmic systems, and/or in the relative thresholds they hold to place trust in these systems. Based on a novel judgment task with a large number of within-subject repetitions, here we report evidence that both mechanisms exert an effect on experimental participant's degree of algorithm adherence, but, importantly, that these two mechanisms are independent from each-other. Furthermore, participants are more likely to place their trust in an algorithmically managed fund if their first exposure to the task was with an algorithmic manager. These findings open the door for future research into the mechanisms driving individual differences in algorithm adherence, and allow for novel interventions to increase adherence to algorithms. © 2021 Fenneman et al.

ID-500,article,Watch Me Improve—Algorithm Aversion and Demonstrating the Ability to Learn,"Owing to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and specifically in machine learning, information technology (IT) systems can support humans in an increasing number of tasks. Yet, previous research indicates that people often prefer human support to support by an IT system, even if the latter provides superior performance – a phenomenon called algorithm aversion. A possible cause of algorithm aversion put forward in literature is that users lose trust in IT systems they become familiar with and perceive to err, for example, making forecasts that turn out to deviate from the actual value. Therefore, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of demonstrating an AI-based system’s ability to learn as a potential countermeasure against algorithm aversion in an incentive-compatible online experiment. The experiment reveals how the nature of an erring advisor (i.e., human vs. algorithmic), its familiarity to the user (i.e., unfamiliar vs. familiar), and its ability to learn (i.e., non-learning vs. learning) influence a decision maker’s reliance on the advisor’s judgement for an objective and non-personal decision task. The results reveal no difference in the reliance on unfamiliar human and algorithmic advisors, but differences in the reliance on familiar human and algorithmic advisors that err. Demonstrating an advisor’s ability to learn, however, offsets the effect of familiarity. Therefore, this study contributes to an enhanced understanding of algorithm aversion and is one of the first to examine how users perceive whether an IT system is able to learn. The findings provide theoretical and practical implications for the employment and design of AI-based systems. © 2020, The Author(s).",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00678-5?utm_source=getftr&utm_medium=getftr&utm_campaign=getftr_pilot,1,1,1,IT,"ability to learn, familiarity to the user",,"no main effect of identity of the advisor (human vs. algorithmic advisor), but there was an interaction between the identity and its ability to learn.

ID-502,article,From satisficing to artificing: The evolution of administrative decision-making in the age of the algorithm,"Algorithmic decision tools (ADTs) are being introduced into public sector organizations to support more accurate and consistent decision-making. Whether they succeed turns, in large part, on how administrators use these tools. This is one of the first empirical studies to explore how ADTs are being used by Street Level Bureaucrats (SLBs). The author develops an original conceptual framework and uses in-depth interviews to explore whether SLBs are ignoring ADTs (algorithm aversion); deferring to ADTs (automation bias); or using ADTs together with their own judgment (an approach the author calls artificing). Interviews reveal that artificing is the most common use-type, followed by aversion, while deference is rare. Five conditions appear to influence how practitioners use ADTs: (a) understanding of the tool (b) perception of human judgment (c) seeing value in the tool (d) being offered opportunities to modify the tool (e) alignment of tool with expectations. © The Author(s) 2021.

ID-503,article,Artificial intelligence in the fashion industry: consumer responses to generative adversarial network (GAN) technology,"Purpose: This study examines consumers' evaluations of product consumption values, purchase intentions and willingness to pay for fashion products designed using generative adversarial network (GAN), an artificial intelligence technology. This research investigates differences between consumers' evaluations of a GAN-generated product and a non-GAN-generated product and tests whether disclosing the use of GAN technology affects consumers' evaluations. Design/methodology/approach: Sample products were developed as experimental stimuli using cycleGAN. Data were collected from 163 members of Generation Y. Participants were assigned to one of the three experimental conditions (i.e. non-GAN-generated images, GAN-generated images with disclosure and GAN-generated images without disclosure). Regression analysis and ANOVA were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Functional, social and epistemic consumption values positively affect willingness to pay in the GAN-generated products. Relative to non-GAN-generated products, willingness to pay is significantly higher for GAN-generated products. Moreover, evaluations of functional value, emotional value and willingness to pay are highest when GAN technology is used, but not disclosed. Originality/value: This study evaluates the utility of GANs from consumers' perspective based on the perceived value of GAN-generated product designs. Findings have practical implications for firms that are considering using GANs to develop products for the retail fashion market. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/2473332983/fulltextPDF/F7AE6E77C6AF4E70PQ/1?accountid=14026&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals,1,1,1,fashion industry,,,,K Sohn and C E Sung and G Koo and O Kwon,10.1108/IJRDM-03-2020-0091,,1,International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management,,,Cited By :34,61-80,,,49,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091022473&doi=10.1108%2fIJRDM-03-2020-0091&partnerID=40&md5=12f57718da666f72e6b0ccd343347ada,2021,,
ID-504,article,The Effects of Situational and Individual Factors on Algorithm Acceptance in COVID-19-Related Decision-Making: A Preregistered Online Experiment,"In times of the COVID-19 pandemic, difficult decisions such as the distribution of ventilators must be made. For many of these decisions, humans could team up with algorithms; however, people often prefer human decision-makers. We examined the role of situational (morality of the scenario; perspective) and individual factors (need for leadership; conventionalism) for algorithm preference in a preregistered online experiment with German adults (n = 1,127). As expected, algorithm preference was lowest in the most moral-laden scenario. The effect of perspective (i.e., decision-makers vs. decision targets) was only significant in the most moral scenario. Need for leadership predicted a stronger algorithm preference, whereas conventionalism was related to weaker algorithm preference. Exploratory analyses revealed that attitudes and knowledge also mattered, stressing the importance of individual factors. © 2021 Authors.",https://stars.library.ucf.edu/hmc/vol3/iss1/3/,1,1,1,medical decision-making,,,,S Utz and L N Wolfers and A S Göritz,10.30658/hmc.3.3,,1,Human-Machine Communication,,,Cited By :6,27-45,,,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146426439&doi=10.30658%2fhmc.3.3&partnerID=40&md5=fea2c995f8649afd4b9d01b2fcf1fd53,2021,,
ID-505,article,To App or Not to App? Understanding Public Resistance to COVID-19 Digital Contact Tracing and its Criminological Relevance,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital contact tracing has been developed and promoted in many countries as a valuable tool to help the fight against the virus, allowing health authorities to react quickly and limit contagion. Very often, however, these tracing apps have faced public resistance, making their use relatively sparse and ineffective. Our study relies on an interdisciplinary approach that brings together criminological and computational expertise to consider the key social dynamics underlying people’s resistance to using the NHS contact-tracing app in England and Wales. The present study analyses a large Twitter dataset to investigate interactions between relevant user accounts and identify the main narrative frames (lack of trust and negative liberties) and mechanisms (polluted information, conspiratorial thinking and reactance) to explain resistance towards use of the NHS contact-tracing app. Our study builds on concepts of User eXperience (UX) and algorithm aversion and demonstrates the relevance of these elements to the key criminological problem of resistance to official technologies. © The Author/s 2021",https://lthj.qut.edu.au/article/view/2012/1154,1,"1, 2",1,medical,,,,A Lavorgna and P Ugwudike and L Carr and Y S Benitez and G S Rekha,10.5204/lthj.2012,,2,"Law, Technology and Humans",,,Cited By :2,28-45,,,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129298507&doi=10.5204%2flthj.2012&partnerID=40&md5=c5e1f846d0081c5c20f41959e2d8a88b,2021,,

ID-507,article,Algorithm appreciation or aversion? Comparing in-service and pre-service teachers’ acceptance of computerized expert models,"Although computerized expert models (i.e., algorithms) could improve educational decisions and judgments, initial research has demonstrated that teachers, like other professional groups, tend to be “algorithm averse.” In the current study, we use behavioral and questionnaire data to examine the extent to which in-service and pre-service (i.e., students in training to become) teachers accept advice from expert models and investigate how teachers' acceptance of expert models could be improved. Although it is often presumed that younger generations are less algorithm averse, we demonstrate that both in-service and pre-service teachers prefer advice from a human source (school counselor) than from an expert model, to a similar extent. Furthermore, we find that advice acceptance depends on the difficulty of the decision task, but we find no evidence that pre-service teachers’ acceptance of computerized advice depends on their numeracy or the Big Five traits of openness and neuroticism. Finally, we find that in-service teachers lacked knowledge of computerized expert models but indicated that advice from expert models would be superior to human advice in certain kinds of tasks. Our results indicate that both in- and pre-service teachers could profit from training about the definition and value of computerized expert models, and we provide suggestions for training and future research. © 2021 The Author",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X21000229?pes=vor,1,1,1,education,,task difficulty,,E Kaufmann,10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100028,,,Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence,,,Cited By :12,,,,2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123935753&doi=10.1016%2fj.caeai.2021.100028&partnerID=40&md5=2017d40bc3349fac0e9ed83b0063764d,2021,,

This study presumes that specific knowledge of a business process is important for AI adoption in hospitality services. A research model, grounded in the artificially intelligent device use acceptance (AIDUA) framework, used data collected from 786 respondents. The model was tested using PLS-SEM methodology. The modified framework was supported by Gen Z, with hedonic motivation having the greatest effect on Gen Z members’ emotions and their willingness to use AI devices in hospitality. The frequency of smartphone usage played a significant moderating role between the perceived effort of AI usage and emotions. This study helps AI designers and business managers when designing and implementing AI devices in a hospitality environment.

ID-509,article,Can Algorithms Legitimize Discrimination?,"Algorithms have been the subject of a heated debate regarding their potential to yield biased decisions. Prior research has focused on documenting algorithmic bias and discussing its origins from a technical standpoint. We look at algorithmic bias from a psychological perspective, raising a fundamental question that has received little attention: are people more or less likely to perceive decisions that yield disparities as biased, when such decisions stem from algorithms as opposed to humans? We find that algorithmic decisions that yield gender or racial disparities are less likely to be perceived as biased than human decisions. This occurs because people believe that algorithms, unlike humans, decontextualize decision-making by neglecting individual characteristics and blindly applying rules and procedures irrespective of whom they are judging. In situations that entail the potential for discrimination, this belief leads people to think that algorithms are more likely than humans to treat everyone equally, thus less likely to yield biased decisions. This asymmetrical perception of bias, which occurs both in the general population and among members of stigmatized groups, leads people to endorse stereotypical beliefs that fuel discrimination and reduces their willingness to act against potentially discriminatory outcomes © 2021 American Psychological Association",https://psycnet-apa-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/fulltext/2021-28943-001.pdf,1,1,1,"university admissions, hiring, parole",,,Ps viewed algorithms as less biased for these high-stakes decisions precisely because they neglect uniqueness,A Bonezzi and M Ostinelli,10.1037/xap0000294,,2,Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied,,,Cited By :30,447-459,,,27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112125462&doi=10.1037%2fxap0000294&partnerID=40&md5=da2d32b40f56d3631c9272b0b28dc2f4,2021,,
ID-510,article,"New Challenges for Ethics: The Social Impact of Posthumanism, Robots, and Artificial Intelligence","The ethical approach to science and technology is based on their use and application in extremely diverse fields. Less prominence has been given to the theme of the profound changes in our conception of human nature produced by the most recent developments in artificial intelligence and robotics due to their capacity to simulate an increasing number of human activities traditionally attributed to man as manifestations of the higher spiritual dimension inherent in his nature. Hence, a kind of contrast between nature and artificiality has ensued in which conformity with nature is presented as a criterion of morality and the artificial is legitimized only as an aid to nature. On the contrary, this essay maintains that artificiality is precisely the specific expression of human nature which has, in fact, made a powerful contribution to the progress of man. However, science and technology do not offer criteria to guide the practical and conceptual use of their own contents simply because they do not contain the conceptual space for the ought-to-be. Therefore, this paper offers a critical analysis of the conceptual models and the most typical products of technoscience as well as a discerning evaluation of the contemporary cultural trend of transhumanism. The position defended here consists of full appreciation of technoscience integrated into a broader framework of specifically human values. © 2021 Lourdes Velázquez G.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108459241&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f5593467&partnerID=40&md5=cfcc46aced3d6140d714511195ee3701,4,,,,,,not an empirical article,L Velázquez G,10.1155/2021/5593467,,,Journal of Healthcare Engineering,,,Cited By :8,,,,2021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108459241&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f5593467&partnerID=40&md5=cfcc46aced3d6140d714511195ee3701,2021,,

ID-512,article,Understanding ai advertising from the consumer perspective what factors determine consumer appreciation of ai-created advertisements?,"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been used to create advertising messages. This study examined the factors that influence consumers’ overall appreciation of AI-created advertisements. The findings indicate that, in addition to its direct effect on consumer reactions to AI-created advertisements, consumers’ perceived objectivity of the general advertisement creation process positively influences machine heuristic—a rule of thumb that machines are more secure and trustworthy than humans. This effect boosted consumer appreciation of AI-created advertisements. Consumers’ perceived objectivity of advertisement creation negatively influenced perceived eeriness of AI advertising, which jeopardized consumer appreciation of AI-created advertisements. Consumers’ feelings of uneasiness with robots were found to have a positive influence on both machine heuristic and perceived eeriness of AI advertising. © 2021, World Advertising Research Center.

ID-513,article,Rise of the machines? The evolving role of ai technologies in high-stakes assessment,"Our world has been transformed by technologies incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) within mass communication, employment, entertainment and many other aspects of our daily lives. However, within the domain of education, it seems that our ways of working and, particularly, assessing have hardly changed at all. We continue to prize examinations and summative testing as the most reliable way to assess educational achievements, and we continue to rely on paper-based test delivery as our modus operandi. Inertia, tradition and aversion to perceived risk have resulted in a lack of innovation (James, 2006), particularly so in the area of high-stakes assessment. The summer of 2020 brought this deficit into very sharp focus with the A-level debacle in England, where grades were awarded, challenged, rescinded and reset. These events are potentially catastrophic in terms of how we trust national examinations, and the problems arise from using just one way to define academic success and one way to operationalize that approach to assessment. While sophisticated digital learning platforms, multimedia technologies and wireless communication are transforming what, when and how learning can take place, transformation in national and international assessment thinking and practice trails behind. In this article, we present some of the current research and advances in AI and how these can be applied to the context of high-stakes assessment. Our discussion focuses not on the question of whether we should be using technologies, but on how we can use them effectively to better support practice. An example from one testing agency in England using a globally popular test of English that assesses oral, aural, reading and written skills is described to explain and propose just how well new technologies can augment assessment theory and practice. © 2021 Richardson and Clesham.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103246819&doi=10.14324%2fLRE.19.1.09&partnerID=40&md5=112cffda84b399adc3db8d7633fdc29a,3,,,,,,,M Richardson and R Clesham,10.14324/LRE.19.1.09,,1,London Review of Education,,,Cited By :20,,,,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103246819&doi=10.14324%2fLRE.19.1.09&partnerID=40&md5=112cffda84b399adc3db8d7633fdc29a,2021,,

ID-516,article,Artificial intelligence versus Maya Angelou: Experimental evidence that people cannot differentiate AI-generated from human-written poetry,"The release of openly available, robust natural language generation algorithms (NLG) has spurred much public attention and debate. One reason lies in the algorithms' purported ability to generate humanlike text across various domains. Empirical evidence using incentivized tasks to assess whether people (a) can distinguish and (b) prefer algorithm-generated versus human-written text is lacking. We conducted two experiments assessing behavioral reactions to the state-of-the-art Natural Language Generation algorithm GPT-2 (Ntotal = 830). Using the identical starting lines of human poems, GPT-2 produced samples of poems. From these samples, either a random poem was chosen (Human-out-of-theloop) or the best one was selected (Human-in-the-loop) and in turn matched with a human-written poem. In a new incentivized version of the Turing Test, participants failed to reliably detect the algorithmicallygenerated poems in the Human-in-the-loop treatment, yet succeeded in the Human-out-of-the-loop treatment. Further, people reveal a slight aversion to algorithm-generated poetry, independent on whether participants were informed about the algorithmic origin of the poem (Transparency) or not (Opacity). We discuss what these results convey about the performance of NLG algorithms to produce human-like text and propose methodologies to study such learning algorithms in human-agent experimental settings. © 2020 The Authors",https://ct.prod.getft.io/c2NvcHVzLGVsc2V2aWVyLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9waWkvUzA3NDc1NjMyMjAzMDMwMzQ_cGVzPXZvcg.I5da3U7QTZDr6KBrC0O5lQofcbjObQ5dNDuyh_d8p14,1,1,1,poetry,,,included an incentivized version of the Turing Test.

The study performs a multi-actors analysis in order to understand how different consumers' point of views can influence the final choice of the best investment. Furthermore, a multi-site analysis explores the spatial variation of NZEB building appreciation in the real estate market. Findings: The PROMETHEE II-based model ranks 16 alternative solutions for the NZEB according to energy, economic and extra-economic criteria. The multi-actors analysis highlights the configuration of the NZEB building that best meets the needs of different end-users, respecting the European directives and national standards. The multi-site analysis concludes that location does not change users' appreciation and not influence the output for the best solution. Originality/value: The MCDA occurs as a support tool that helps to optimize the preliminary design phase of NZEB through the exploration of the optimal solution considering crucial criteria in the energy and environmental and real estate market rules. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082846353&doi=10.1108%2fSASBE-09-2019-0121&partnerID=40&md5=9cd8a5f7780cf6529d246537bcaf505a,3,,,,,,,F Dell'Anna and M Bottero and C Becchio and S P Corgnati and G Mondini,10.1108/SASBE-09-2019-0121,,4,Smart and Sustainable Built Environment,,,Cited By :24,413-442,,,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082846353&doi=10.1108%2fSASBE-09-2019-0121&partnerID=40&md5=9cd8a5f7780cf6529d246537bcaf505a,2020,,
ID-518,article,"Low-cost methods to assess beer quality using artificial intelligence involving robotics, an electronic nose, and machine learning","Beer quality is a difficult concept to describe and assess by physicochemical and sensory analysis due to the complexity of beer appreciation and acceptability by consumers, which can be dynamic and related to changes in climate affecting raw materials, consumer preference, and rising quality requirements. Artificial intelligence (AI) may offer unique capabilities based on the integration of sensor technology, robotics, and data analysis using machine learning (ML) to identify specific quality traits and process modifications to produce quality beers. This research presented the integration and implementation of AI technology based on low-cost sensor networks in the form of an electronic nose (e-nose), robotics, and ML. Results of ML showed high accuracy (97%) in the identification of fermentation type (Model 1) based on e-nose data; prediction of consumer acceptability from near-infrared (Model 2; R = 0.90) and e-nose data (Model 3; R = 0.95), and physicochemical and colorimetry of beers from e-nose data. The use of the RoboBEER coupled with the e-nose and AI could be used by brewers to assess the fermentation process, quality of beers, detection of faults, traceability, and authentication purposes in an affordable, user-friendly, and accurate manner. © 2020 by the authors.

ID-520,article,Artificial intelligence visual metaphors in e-learning interfaces for learning analytics,"This work proposes an innovative visual tool for real-time continuous learners analytics. The purpose of the work is to improve the design, functionality, and usability of learning management systems to monitor user activity to allow educators to make informed decisions on e-learning design, usually limited to dashboards graphs, tables, and low-usability user logs. The standard visualisation is currently scarce, and often inadequate to inform educators about the design quality and students engagement on their learning objects. The same low usability can be found in learning analytics tools, which mostly focus on post-course analysis, demanding specific skills to be effectively used, e.g., for statistical analysis and database queries. We propose a tool for student analytics embedded in a Learning Management System, based on the innovative visual metaphor of interface morphing. Artificial intelligence provides in remote learning immediate feedback, crucial in a face-to-face setting, highlighting the students’ engagement in each single learning object. A visual metaphor is the representation of a person, group, learning object, or concept through a visual image that suggests a particular association or point of similarity. The basic idea is that elements of the application interface, e.g., learning objects’ icons and student avatars, can be modified in colour and dimension to reflect key performance indicators of learner’s activities. The goal is to provide high-affordance information on the student engagement and usage of learning objects, where aggregation functions on subsets of users allow a dynamic evaluation of cohorts with different granularity. The proposed visual metaphors (i.e., thermometer bar, dimensional morphing, and tag cloud morphing) have been implemented and experimented within academic-level courses. Experimental results have been evaluated with a comparative analysis of user logs and a subjective usability survey, which show that the tool obtains quantitative, measurable effectiveness and the qualitative appreciation of educators. Among metaphors, the highest success is obtained by Dimensional morphing and Tag cloud transformation. © 2020 by the authors.

ID-521,article,"Matter over mind? How the acceptance of digital entities depends on their appearance, mental prowess, and the interaction between both","Digital technologies are advancing rapidly, growing to be more human-like and intelligent by the day. However, research shows that a machine's resemblance to humans can reach a critical level, which makes it seem uncanny to observers. While scholars have discussed this effect in terms of both human-like appearances and mental abilities, a potential interaction between the two aspects has hardly been addressed in literature. We designed a two-factorial experiment to overcome the identified research gap, introducing participants to digital agents with varying embodiment (text interface/human rendering) and mental capacity (simple algorithms/complex artificial intelligence). Our results show that the interaction of both factors indeed affects participants’ experience in a crucial way: Whereas an agent based on simple algorithms only evokes discomfort when embedded in a human-like body, the artificial intelligence is always perceived as eerie, regardless of its embodiment. Yet, additional findings raise doubts on the unidimensionality of participants’ affective response. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581920300653?via%3Dihub,1,1,1,,human embodiment (made to look like a human or not) and actual ability of the algorithm (simple or complex),,uncanny valley,J.-P.

ID-522,article,"A posthuman ecology of simulated human patients: Eidolons, empathy and fidelity in the uncanny embodiment of nursing practice","The reproduction of the human form has been a universal practice amongst human ecologies for millennia. Over the past 200 years, popular culture has considered the imaginary consequences of the danger to humanity and human-ness of replicating the autonomous human form too faithfully. Today, the seductive allure of technologically advanced simulated human bodies and advances in robotics and artificial intelligence has brought us closer to facing this possibility. Alongside the simultaneous aversion and fascination of the possibility that autonomous simulated human forms may become indistinguishable from human beings is the deep-rooted uncanniness of the automaton in its strange familiarity – not only to ourselves but to our pleasant childhood imaginings of playing with dolls. As such, simulated human bodies are often enrolled in medical and nursing education models with the assumption that making the simulation teaching spaces seem as close to clinical spaces as possible will allow students to practise potentially harmful clinical skills without causing any harm to human patients. However similar the simulated human bodies may appear to a living, breathing human, a tension between the embodiment of particularly human attributes and their replication persists. How can computerized human patient simulators be enrolled to teach people to develop the necessary attributes of compassion and empathy when caring for human beings? This article explores the uncanny ecologies of simulated human patients in nursing education by presenting a posthuman analysis of the practices of nurse educators as they enrol these digital objects in their teaching. Guided by a selection of heuristics offered as a mode of interviewing digital objects, the analysis enrolled ‘Gathering Anecdotes’ and ‘Unravelling Translations’ to attune to the ways in which these uncanny posthuman assemblages become powerful modes of knowing to mobilize learning about human attributes within uncanny posthuman ecologies. © 2020 Intellect Ltd Article.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100739027&doi=10.1386%2feme_00048_1&partnerID=40&md5=e591392271d2b1f4a60b842766fc47cd,3,,,,,,,A Ireland,10.1386/eme_00048_1,,3,Explorations in Media Ecology,,,Cited By :1,299-318,,,19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100739027&doi=10.1386%2feme_00048_1&partnerID=40&md5=e591392271d2b1f4a60b842766fc47cd,2020,,

In particular, we seek to understand linkages between customer perceptions of AI service quality, AI customer satisfaction and engagement. Given the multiplicity of services offered by service organisations, customers’ preference for AI service is modelled as a moderator of customer perceptions and attitudes towards AI. Data was collected from a sample of hotel customers in Australia who had previously used AI tools or services. Our results reveal a significant chain effect between AI service indicators, service quality perceptions, AI satisfaction and customer engagement. AI preference has a significant moderation effect on information quality and satisfaction.

ID-524,article,In AI we trust? Perceptions about automated decision-making by artificial intelligence,"Fueled by ever-growing amounts of (digital) data and advances in artificial intelligence, decision-making in contemporary societies is increasingly delegated to automated processes. Drawing from social science theories and from the emerging body of research about algorithmic appreciation and algorithmic perceptions, the current study explores the extent to which personal characteristics can be linked to perceptions of automated decision-making by AI, and the boundary conditions of these perceptions, namely the extent to which such perceptions differ across media, (public) health, and judicial contexts. Data from a scenario-based survey experiment with a national sample (N = 958) show that people are by and large concerned about risks and have mixed opinions about fairness and usefulness of automated decision-making at a societal level, with general attitudes influenced by individual characteristics. Interestingly, decisions taken automatically by AI were often evaluated on par or even better than human experts for specific decisions. Theoretical and societal implications about these findings are discussed. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-019-00931-w,1,1,1,"media, public health, judicial",,,vignette-experiment with 2 (decision-maker: Human vs. AI) × 2 (subject of the decision: self vs. others) × 2 (impact of the decision: high vs. low),T Araujo and N Helberger and S Kruikemeier and C H de Vreese,10.1007/s00146-019-00931-w,,3,AI and Society,,,Cited By :346,611-623,,,35,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077189754&doi=10.1007%2fs00146-019-00931-w&partnerID=40&md5=f1661ebef5893d62b6e97e4ea35b8b31,2020,,

ID-529,article,Beyond user experience: What constitutes algorithmic experiences?,"Algorithms are progressively transforming human experience, especially, the interaction with businesses, governments, education, and entertainment. As a result, people are growingly seeing the outside world, in a sense, through the lens of algorithms. Despite the importance of algorithmic experience (AX), few studies had been devoted to investigating the nature and processes through which users perceive and actualize the potential for algorithm affordance. This study proposes the Algorithm Acceptance Model to conceptualize the notion of AX as part of the analytic framework for human-algorithm interaction. It then tests how AX shapes the satisfaction with and acceptance of algorithm services. The results show that AX is inherently related to human understanding of fairness, transparency, and other conventional components of user-experience, indicating the heuristic roles of transparency and fairness regarding their underlying relations of user experience and trust. AX can influence the user perception of algorithmic systems in the context of algorithm ecology, offering useful insights into the design of human-centered algorithm systems. The findings provide initial and robust support for the proposed Algorithm Acceptance Model. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401219314161?via%3Dihub,1,1,1,,"fairness, usefulness",,,D Shin and B Zhong and F A Biocca,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.102061,,,International Journal of Information Management,,,Cited By :93,,,,52,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077915121&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijinfomgt.2019.102061&partnerID=40&md5=f0f296f866cd673ed2c34dd3069f6fb8,2020,,
ID-530,article,"Who errs? Algorithm aversion, the source of judicial error, and public support for self-help behaviors","People often turn to self-help behaviors when formal processes of the state deteriorate, becoming inaccessible or ineffective. This deterioration can often include real or alleged inaccuracies in the courts that lower trust and confidence in the judicial system. Increasingly, one potential source of error in the courts is algorithmic, with more and more facets of the judicial system incorporating actuarial assessments. In this paper, I examine whether trust and confidence, separate from legitimacy, and the source of judicial error–humans or algorithms–matter for declared support of self-help behaviors, such as naming and shaming on social media, protesting, and violent economic protesting. In the experiment, respondents read information about identical levels of judicial error made by either a human or algorithm. They then indicated their attitudes towards the judicial systems and self-help behaviors. Respondents that read about algorithm-error had greater odds of supporting some self-help behaviors. In addition, the level of trust in the courts, and not legitimacy, mattered most for support of self-help behaviors. The paper discusses potential mechanisms behind the differences between the human- and algorithmic-error groups as well as the distinction between trust and legitimacy for self-help behaviors. © 2019, © 2019 Midwestern Criminal Justice Association.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071156560&doi=10.1080%2f0735648X.2019.1655781&partnerID=40&md5=658fb229d02654aa0d378c5a09454e06,4,,,,,,paywall,L Ireland,10.1080/0735648X.2019.1655781,,2,Journal of Crime and Justice,,,Cited By :13,174-192,,,43,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071156560&doi=10.1080%2f0735648X.2019.1655781&partnerID=40&md5=658fb229d02654aa0d378c5a09454e06,2020,,
ID-531,article,Slow response times undermine trust in algorithmic (but not human) predictions,"Algorithms consistently perform well on various prediction tasks, but people often mistrust their advice. Here, we demonstrate one component that affects people's trust in algorithmic predictions: response time. In seven studies (total N = 1928 with 14,184 observations), we find that people judge slowly generated predictions from algorithms as less accurate and they are less willing to rely on them. This effect reverses for human predictions, where slowly generated predictions are judged to be more accurate. In explaining this asymmetry, we find that slower response times signal the exertion of effort for both humans and algorithms. However, the relationship between perceived effort and prediction quality differs for humans and algorithms. For humans, prediction tasks are seen as difficult and observing effort is therefore positively correlated with the perceived quality of predictions. For algorithms, however, prediction tasks are seen as easy and effort is therefore uncorrelated to the quality of algorithmic predictions. These results underscore the complex processes and dynamics underlying people's trust in algorithmic (and human) predictions and the cues that people use to evaluate their quality. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074959781930192X?via%3Dihub#s0015,1,1,1,,,,2 (Prediction provider: Human vs. Algorithm; between-subjects) × 2 (Response time: Fast vs. Slow; within-subjects) mixed-design experiment; Predicted that slowly-generated predictions are perceived favorably for humans but unfavorably for algorithms.

Starting with a concept of combinatorial inventiveness which is central to artefactual creativity, I summarize its roles in the arts and culture, leading to its applications in new media art. With regards to the diversity of practices in this domain, I focus on generative art projects created primarily by processing the material from cinema, television and the Internet. These projects blend procedural thinking with bricolage, leverage complex technical infrastructures, foster curiosity and encourage vigilance in our critical appreciation of the arts, technology, culture, society, and human nature. I discuss their methodologies, poetic features, cultural and social contexts in three sections which exemplify the effects and consequences of computational paradigm: Database logic, statistical abstraction, and quantification.

ID-542,article,Task-Dependent Algorithm Aversion,"Research suggests that consumers are averse to relying on algorithms to perform tasks that are typically done by humans, despite the fact that algorithms often perform better. The authors explore when and why this is true in a wide variety of domains. They find that algorithms are trusted and relied on less for tasks that seem subjective (vs. objective) in nature. However, they show that perceived task objectivity is malleable and that increasing a task’s perceived objectivity increases trust in and use of algorithms for that task. Consumers mistakenly believe that algorithms lack the abilities required to perform subjective tasks. Increasing algorithms’ perceived affective human-likeness is therefore effective at increasing the use of algorithms for subjective tasks. These findings are supported by the results of four online lab studies with over 1,400 participants and two online field studies with over 56,000 participants. The results provide insights into when and why consumers are likely to use algorithms and how marketers can increase their use when they outperform humans. © American Marketing Association 2019.",https://content.ebscohost.com/cds/retrieve?content=AQICAHiylJ_bvOB56hI8UzTN6Ryruh7a0kiIBN_ANwtaWYjmxwFWGPqGoqLRfgzs7i3aXamaAAAA4zCB4AYJKoZIhvcNAQcGoIHSMIHPAgEAMIHJBgkqhkiG9w0BBwEwHgYJYIZIAWUDBAEuMBEEDEZIX9qavuUXfcoO6wIBEICBm1ZFhKsC25mRdQqB0u0RulXVU9kBo3-2z5A2bu4XA5NZSTWCw42ApZT2AuNryrlcaMzH3oLQFdRvMP77pHYQrfAf8LwjTPD-25a0YemgaqW2UInCGIyPqpjmWTJUI_sfnjTmqe9Z9G8ChUjPfqS9cd_IH3LVmTbKUPsXsM91l8eF-Up7QNbOhf93ZTHyIzBwuFCafE-RZKkGWecv,1,1,1,"dating, financial advice, medical diagnosis, judge joke quality...See Table 4",human likeness,subjective vs. objective,making a task seem more objective can reduce people's algorithm aversion.

ID-543,article,Psychosocial factors affecting artificial intelligence adoption in health care in China: Cross-sectional study,"Background: Poor quality primary health care is a major issue in China, particularly in blindness prevention. Artificial intelligence (AI) could provide early screening and accurate auxiliary diagnosis to improve primary care services and reduce unnecessary referrals, but the application of AI in medical settings is still an emerging field. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the general public's acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices, with reference to those already used in China, and the interrelated influencing factors that shape people's intention to use these devices. Methods: We proposed a model of ophthalmic AI acceptance based on technology acceptance theories and variables from other health care-related studies. The model was verified via a 32-item questionnaire with 7-point Likert scales completed by 474 respondents (nationally random sampled). Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate item and construct reliability and validity via a confirmatory factor analysis, and the model's path effects, significance, goodness of fit, and mediation and moderation effects were analyzed. Results: Standardized factor loadings of items were between 0.583 and 0.876. Composite reliability of 9 constructs ranged from 0.673 to 0.841. The discriminant validity of all constructs met the Fornell and Larcker criteria. Model fit indicators such as standardized root mean square residual (0.057), comparative fit index (0.915), and root mean squared error of approximation (0.049) demonstrated good fit. Intention to use (R2=0.515) is significantly affected by subjective norms (beta=.408; P<.001), perceived usefulness (beta=.336; P=.03), and resistance bias (beta=-.237; P=.02). Subjective norms and perceived behavior control had an indirect impact on intention to use through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Eye health consciousness had an indirect positive effect on intention to use through perceived usefulness. Trust had a significant moderation effect (beta=-.095; P=.049) on the effect path of perceived usefulness to intention to use. Conclusions: The item, construct, and model indicators indicate reliable interpretation power and help explain the levels of public acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices in China. The influence of subjective norms can be linked to Confucian culture, collectivism, authoritarianism, and conformity mentality in China. Overall, the use of AI in diagnostics and clinical laboratory analysis is underdeveloped, and the Chinese public are generally mistrustful of medical staff and the Chinese medical system. Stakeholders such as doctors and AI suppliers should therefore avoid making misleading or over-exaggerated claims in the promotion of AI health care products. © 2019 Tiantian Ye, Jiaolong Xue, Mingguang He, Jing Gu, Haotian Lin, Bin Xu, Yu Cheng.",https://www.jmir.org/2019/10/e14316/,1,1,1,medical,"perceived control, ease of use",,,T Ye and J Xue and M He and J Gu and H Lin and B Xu and Y Cheng,10.2196/14316,,10,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,,Cited By :62,,,,21,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073603025&doi=10.2196%2f14316&partnerID=40&md5=5f542e5a27439daa91b1c5f131e463d5,2019,,
ID-544,article,Algorithm Overdependence: How the Use of Algorithmic Recommendation Systems Can Increase Risks to Consumer Well-Being,"Consumers increasingly encounter recommender systems when making consumption decisions of all kinds. While numerous efforts have aimed to improve the quality of algorithm-generated recommendations, evidence has indicated that people often remain averse to superior algorithmic sources of information in favor of their own personal intuitions (a type II problem). The current work highlights an additional (type I) problem associated with the use of recommender systems: algorithm overdependence. Five experiments illustrate that, stemming from a belief that algorithms hold greater domain expertise, consumers surrender to algorithm-generated recommendations even when the recommendations are inferior. Counter to prior findings, this research indicates that consumers frequently depend too much on algorithm-generated recommendations, posing potential harms to their own well-being and leading them to play a role in propagating systemic biases that can influence other users. Given the rapidly expanding application of recommender systems across consumer domains, the authors believe that an appreciation and understanding of these risks is crucial to the effective guidance and development of recommendation systems that support consumer interests. © American Marketing Association 2019.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0743915619858057?casa_token=_zUDocJb4iMAAAAA:yr0pJh84lvkodmkJPpHDs2GaDAXtZEV87NaJ_hodwcoUYxLWwsythl7k-p-1w-J8Fq3kdjLKEzS4,1,1,1,e-commerce,,,"dominated = inferior recommendation, nondominated = superior recommendation.

ID-545,article,“It would be pretty immoral to choose a random algorithm”: Opening up algorithmic interpretability and transparency,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report on empirical work conducted to open up algorithmic interpretability and transparency. In recent years, significant concerns have arisen regarding the increasing pervasiveness of algorithms and the impact of automated decision-making in our lives. Particularly problematic is the lack of transparency surrounding the development of these algorithmic systems and their use. It is often suggested that to make algorithms more fair, they should be made more transparent, but exactly how this can be achieved remains unclear. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study was conducted to begin unpacking issues around algorithmic interpretability and transparency. The study involved discussion-based experiments centred around a limited resource allocation scenario which required participants to select their most and least preferred algorithms in a particular context. In addition to collecting quantitative data about preferences, qualitative data captured participants’ expressed reasoning behind their selections. Findings: Even when provided with the same information about the scenario, participants made different algorithm preference selections and rationalised their selections differently. The study results revealed diversity in participant responses but consistency in the emphasis they placed on normative concerns and the importance of context when accounting for their selections. The issues raised by participants as important to their selections resonate closely with values that have come to the fore in current debates over algorithm prevalence. Originality/value: This work developed a novel empirical approach that demonstrates the value in pursuing algorithmic interpretability and transparency while also highlighting the complexities surrounding their accomplishment. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064059515&doi=10.1108%2fJICES-11-2018-0092&partnerID=40&md5=34ce2e453a8c57f7f80b38e6237052aa,1,"1, 2",1,,,,,H Webb and M Patel and M Rovatsos and A Davoust and S Ceppi and A Koene and L Dowthwaite and V Portillo and M Jirotka and M Cano,10.1108/JICES-11-2018-0092,,2,"Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society",,,Cited By :10,210-228,,,17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064059515&doi=10.1108%2fJICES-11-2018-0092&partnerID=40&md5=34ce2e453a8c57f7f80b38e6237052aa,2019,,
ID-546,article,Trusting forecasts,"Accurate forecasting is necessary to remain competitive in today's business environment. Forecast support systems are designed to aid forecasters in achieving high accuracy. However, studies have shown that people are distrustful of automated forecasters. This has recently been dubbed “algorithm aversion.” In this study, we explore the relationship between trust and forecasts, and if trust can be boosted in order to achieve a higher acceptance rate of system forecasts and lessen the occurrence of damaging adjustments. In a survey with 134 executives, we ask them to rate the determinants of trust in forecasts, what trust in forecasting means to them, and how trust in forecasts can be increased. The findings point to four main factors that play a role in trusting forecasts: (a) the forecast bundle, (b) forecaster competence, (c) combination of forecasts, and (d) knowledge. Implications of these factors for designing effective forecast support and future-focused management processes are discussed. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119946961&doi=10.1002%2fffo2.19&partnerID=40&md5=3f1959ef9c1adaaaecc4ee87666c7da9,1,1,1,,,,,D Önkal and M S Gönül and S De Baets,10.1002/ffo2.19,,3-4,Futures and Foresight Science,,,Cited By :10,,,,1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119946961&doi=10.1002%2fffo2.19&partnerID=40&md5=3f1959ef9c1adaaaecc4ee87666c7da9,2019,,
ID-547,article,"Role of fairness, accountability, and transparency in algorithmic affordance","As algorithm-based services increase, social topics such as fairness, transparency, and accountability (FAT) must be addressed. This study conceptualizes such issues and examines how they influence the use and adoption of algorithm services. In particular, we investigate how trust is related to such issues and how trust influences the user experience of algorithm services. A multi-mixed method was used by integrating interpretive methods and surveys. The overall results show the heuristic role of fairness, accountability, and transparency, regarding their fundamental links to trust. Despite the importance of algorithms, no single testable definition has been observed. We reconstructed the understandings of algorithm and its affordance with user perception, invariant properties, and contextuality. The study concludes by arguing that algorithmic affordance offers a distinctive perspective on the conceptualization of algorithmic process. Individuals’ perceptions of FAT and how they actually perceive them are important topics for further study. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563219301591?via%3Dihub,1,1,1,,"fairness, transparency, accountability",,,D Shin and Y J Park,10.1016/j.chb.2019.04.019,,,Computers in Human Behavior,,,Cited By :228,277-284,,,98,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065764209&doi=10.1016%2fj.chb.2019.04.019&partnerID=40&md5=203147582223a20b6fee22fb77a8a0ba,2019,,

ID-552,article,Student perceptions of an active learning module to enhance data and modeling skills in undergraduate water resources engineering education,"This article describes the design, development, and evaluation of an undergraduate learning module that builds students’ skills on how data analysis and numerical modeling can be used to analyze and design water resources engineering projects. The module follows a project-based approach by using a hydrologic restoration project in a coastal basin in south Louisiana, USA. The module has two main phases, a feasibility analysis phase and a hydraulic design phase, and follows an active learning approach where students perform a set of quantitative learning activities that involve extensive data and modeling analyses. The module is designed using open resources, including online datasets, hydraulic simulation models and geographical information system software that are typically used by the engineering industry and research communities. Upon completing the module, students develop skills that involve model formulation, parameter calibration, sensitivity analysis, and the use of data and models to assess and design a hydrologic a proposed hydrologic engineering project. Guided by design-based research framework, the implementation and evaluation of the module focused primarily on assessing students’ perceptions of the module usability and its design attributes, their perceived contribution of the module to their learning, and their overall receptiveness of the module and how it impacts their interest in the subject and future careers. Following an improvement-focused evaluation approach, design attributes that were found most critical to students included the use of user-support resources and self-checking mechanisms. These aspects were identified as key features that facilitate students’ self-learning and independent completion of tasks, while still enriching their learning experiences when using data and modeling-rich applications. Evaluation data showed that the following attributes contributed the most to students’ learning and potential value for future careers: application of modern engineering data analysis; use of real-world hydrologic datasets; and appreciation of uncertainties and challenges imposed by data scarcity. The evaluation results were used to formulate a set of guiding principles on how to design effective and conducive undergraduate learning experiences that adopt technology-enhanced and data and modeling-based strategies, on how to enhance users’ experiences with free and open-source engineering analysis tools, and on how to strike a pedagogical balance between module complexity, student engagement, and flexibility to fit within existing curricula limitations. © 2019 TEMPUS Publications.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078493524&partnerID=40&md5=9dec88b61a29d3a8b67accff63a4012d,3,,,,,,,E Habib and M Deshotel and L A I Guolin and R Miller,,,5,International Journal of Engineering Education,,,Cited By :14,1353-1365,,,35,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078493524&partnerID=40&md5=9dec88b61a29d3a8b67accff63a4012d,2019,,

We built upon an existing smoking cessation health recommender system that delivered motivational messages through a mobile app. A group of experts assessed how the system may be improved to address the behavioral change determinants of the I-Change behavioral change model. The resulting system features a hybrid recommender algorithm for computer tailoring smoking cessation messages. A total of 331 different motivational messages were designed using 10 health communication methods. The algorithm was designed to match 58 message characteristics to each user profile by following the principles of the I-Change model and maintaining the benefits of the recommender system algorithms. The mobile app resulted in a streamlined version that aimed to improve the user experience, and this system's design bridges the gap between health recommender systems and the use of behavioral change theories. This article presents a novel approach integrating recommender system technology, health behavior technology, and computer-tailored technology. Future researchers will be able to build upon the principles applied in this case study. © 2013 IEEE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076967280&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2957696&partnerID=40&md5=32b7e98b9be74d1ec92c096ed7741589,3,,,,,,,S Hors-Fraile and H De Vries and S Malwade and F Luna-Perejon and C Amaya and A Civit and F Schneider and P Bamidis and S Syed-Abdul and Y.-C.

ID-557,article,People are averse to machines making moral decisions,"Do people want autonomous machines making moral decisions? Nine studies suggest that that the answer is ‘no’—in part because machines lack a complete mind. Studies 1–6 find that people are averse to machines making morally-relevant driving, legal, medical, and military decisions, and that this aversion is mediated by the perception that machines can neither fully think nor feel. Studies 5–6 find that this aversion exists even when moral decisions have positive outcomes. Studies 7–9 briefly investigate three potential routes to increasing the acceptability of machine moral decision-making: limiting the machine to an advisory role (Study 7), increasing machines’ perceived experience (Study 8), and increasing machines’ perceived expertise (Study 9). Although some of these routes show promise, the aversion to machine moral decision-making is difficult to eliminate. This aversion may prove challenging for the integration of autonomous technology in moral domains including medicine, the law, the military, and self-driving vehicles. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718302087?via%3Dihub,1,1,1,"driving, legal, medical, military","experience, expertise",,mind perception,Y E Bigman and K Gray,10.1016/j.cognition.2018.08.003,,,Cognition,,,Cited By :269,21-34,,,181,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051401081&doi=10.1016%2fj.cognition.2018.08.003&partnerID=40&md5=80637d76be25ed53fb3ecc6af67500e7,2018,,

ID-560,article,Games between humans and AIs,"Various potential strategic interactions between a “strong” Artificial intelligence (AI) and humans are analyzed using simple 2 × 2 order games, drawing on the New Periodic Table of those games developed by Robinson and Goforth (The topology of the 2 × 2 games: a new periodic table. Routledge, London, 2005). Strong risk aversion on the part of the human player(s) leads to shutting down the AI research program, but alternative preference orderings by the human and the AI result in Nash equilibria with interesting properties. Some of the AI-Human games have multiple equilibria, and in other cases Pareto-improvement over the Nash equilibrium could be attained if the AI’s behavior towards humans could be guaranteed to be benign. The preferences of a superintelligent AI cannot be known in advance, but speculation is possible as to its ranking of alternative states of the world, and how it might assimilate the accumulated wisdom (and folly) of humanity. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020109041&doi=10.1007%2fs00146-017-0732-5&partnerID=40&md5=bfa514733ca2fd785f348492c8c0df82,3,,,,,,,S J DeCanio,10.1007/s00146-017-0732-5,,4,AI and Society,,,Cited By :1,557-564,,,33,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020109041&doi=10.1007%2fs00146-017-0732-5&partnerID=40&md5=bfa514733ca2fd785f348492c8c0df82,2018,,

ID-564,article,Maternal and child patient safety: A multiple criteria analysis of the decision-making preferences of nurse managers,"Objectives: to establish the decision preferences of nurse managers with emphasis on maternal-child patient safety, in order to understand how to prioritize actions and investments in the application of nursing assignments should be given. Methods: a quantitative research with convenience sampling and a MCDA methodology (Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis) was operationalized by the PROMETHEE algorithm (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations) through the use of a graphical preference capture tool and sensitivity analysis to ensure the robustness of the model. A consolidation of the criteria was carried out by means of the dimensions: reception, classification, assistance, orientation, team integration and administrative services, defined by criteria similarity and calculated by means of weighted preference indexes. Results: a greater decision preference or relative importance was attributed to the professional category Obstetric Nurses (46.47%), which stood out with the highest preferences in three dimensions: Integration (22.74%), Assistance (13.37%) and Administrative Aspects (10.36%). The dimensions not directly involved with the patient (Team Integration and Administrative Aspects), altogether had a high decision-making preference or relative weight (47.96%). Conclusions: the model of decision-making preferences furnished innovative contributions in regard to the priority established on actions and investments to create greater safety for maternal and child patients. © 2018, Instituto Materno Infantil Professor Fernando Figueira.

ID-581,article,Understanding algorithm aversion: When is advice from automation discounted?,"Forecasting advice from human advisors is often utilized more than advice from automation. There is little understanding of why “algorithm aversion” occurs, or specific conditions that may exaggerate it. This paper first reviews literature from two fields—interpersonal advice and human–automation trust—that can inform our understanding of the underlying causes of the phenomenon. Then, an experiment is conducted to search for these underlying causes. We do not replicate the finding that human advice is generally utilized more than automated advice. However, after receiving bad advice, utilization of automated advice decreased significantly more than advice from humans. We also find that decision makers describe themselves as having much more in common with human than automated advisors despite there being no interpersonal relationship in our study. Results are discussed in relation to other findings from the forecasting and human–automation trust fields and provide a new perspective on what causes and exaggerates algorithm aversion.

ID-584,article,More human than human,"Within the literature surrounding nonhuman animals on the one hand and cognitively disabled humans on the other, there is much discussion of where beings that do not satisfy the criteria for personhood fit in our moral deliberations. In the future, we may face a different but related problem: That we might create (or cause the creation of) beings that not only satisfy but exceed these criteria. The question becomes whether these are minimal criteria, or hierarchical, such that those who fulfill them to greater degree should be afforded greater consideration. This article questions the validity and necessity of drawing divisions among beings that satisfy the minimum requirements for personhood; considering how future beings - intelligent androids, synthezoids, even alternate-substrate sentiences - might fit alongside the baseline human. I ask whether these alternate beings ought to be considered different to us, and why this may or may not matter in terms of a notion of human community. The film Blade Runner, concerned in large part with humanity and its key synthezoid antagonist Roy Batty, forms a framing touchstone for my discussion. Batty is stronger, faster, more resilient, and more intelligent than Homo sapiens. His exploits, far beyond the capability of normal humans, are contrasted with his frailty and transient lifespan, his aesthetic appreciation of the sights he has seen, and his burgeoning empathy. Not for nothing does his creator within the mythos term him more human than human. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019997561&doi=10.1017%2fS0963180116001158&partnerID=40&md5=e3142c138b00fcf2ae2397005a02231c,3,,,,,,,D Lawrence,10.1017/S0963180116001158,,3,Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics,,,Cited By :13,476-490,,,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019997561&doi=10.1017%2fS0963180116001158&partnerID=40&md5=e3142c138b00fcf2ae2397005a02231c,2017,,

ID-592,article,Predicting adherence to aromatase inhibitor therapy among breast cancer survivors: An application of the protection motivation theory,"The purpose of this observational study was to determine if the Protection Motivation Theory could predict and explain adherence to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy among breast cancer survivors. Purposive sampling was used to identify 288 survivors who had been prescribed AI therapy. A valid and reliable survey was mailed to survivors. A total of 145 survivors completed the survey. The Morisky scale was used to measure adherence to AI. The survivors reported a mean score of 6.84 (±0.66) on the scale. Nearly 4 in 10 survivors (38%) were non-adherent. Adherence differed by age, marital status, insurance status, income, and presence of co-morbid conditions. Self-efficacy (r=0.485), protection motivation (r=0.310), and Response Efficacy (r=0.206) were positively and significantly correlated with adherence. Response Cost (r=-0.235) was negatively correlated with adherence. The coping appraisal constructs were statistically significant predictors medication adherence (β=0.437) with self-efficacy being the strongest significant predictor of adherence (β = 0.429). © The Author(s) 2017.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014805422&doi=10.1177%2f1178223417694520&partnerID=40&md5=f7d2b2dfbc4c31da1f6d2897a2ab8a03,3,,,,,,,M Karmakar and S L Pinto and T R Jordan and I Mohamed and M Holiday-Goodman,10.1177/1178223417694520,,,Breast Cancer: Basic and Clinical Research,,,Cited By :27,,,,11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014805422&doi=10.1177%2f1178223417694520&partnerID=40&md5=f7d2b2dfbc4c31da1f6d2897a2ab8a03,2017,,

ID-601,article,Multicriteria decision making inspired by human cognitive processes,"In this study, we present an approach to multi-criteria decision-making modeling inspired by human cognitive processes. The proposed model exploits the ideas of fuzzy sets, balanced fuzzy sets and their connectives, namely t-norms, t-conorms and derived connectives. Balanced connectives are compared and contrasted with unipolar fuzzy connectives. Our objective is to capture complex aspects of decision-making processes. We consider imperfect bipolar information that engages positive and negative aspects and leads to decisions. Furthermore, we investigate behavioral biases. This allows us to provide a detailed insight into decision-making processes realized by human beings and their biases: impact of arguments ordering on the decision, risk aversion, and impact of input arguments fading with time. We investigate and describe the suitability of selected triangular and balanced connectives for decision-making modeling inspired by cognitive processes. We compare different pairs of standard t-norms, t-conorms and balanced counterparts, and discuss their abilities to model various, also irrational, aspects of human behavior. The developed two-step procedure is applied to decision-making modeling presented as a case study and compared with a method known in the literature. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976340236&doi=10.1016%2fj.amc.2016.05.041&partnerID=40&md5=ff30cd7f54e1e8a5ff1dfb0a249791d1,3,,,,,,,W Homenda and A Jastrzebska and W Pedrycz,10.1016/j.amc.2016.05.041,,,Applied Mathematics and Computation,,,Cited By :16,392-411,,,290,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976340236&doi=10.1016%2fj.amc.2016.05.041&partnerID=40&md5=ff30cd7f54e1e8a5ff1dfb0a249791d1,2016,,

ID-606,article,A Cautionary Contribution to the Philosophy of Explanation in the Cognitive Neurosciences,"I propose a cautionary assessment of the recent debate concerning the impact of the dynamical approach on philosophical accounts of scientific explanation in the cognitive sciences and, particularly, the cognitive neurosciences. I criticize the dominant mechanistic philosophy of explanation, pointing out a number of its negative consequences: In particular, that it doesn’t do justice to the field’s diversity and stage of development, and that it fosters misguided interpretations of dynamical models’ contribution. In order to support these arguments, I analyze a case study in computational neuroethology and show why it should not be understood through a mechanistic lens; I specially focus on Zednik’s mechanistic interpretation of the case study. In addition, I argue for a greater appreciation of the relation between explanation and other epistemic goals in the field, as well as an increased sensitivity towards the associated contextual factors. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959097527&doi=10.1007%2fs11023-016-9395-0&partnerID=40&md5=4567fb2836d4aab2284e883b40a3df71,3,,,,,,,A N Venturelli,10.1007/s11023-016-9395-0,,3,Minds and Machines,,,Cited By :8,259-285,,,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959097527&doi=10.1007%2fs11023-016-9395-0&partnerID=40&md5=4567fb2836d4aab2284e883b40a3df71,2016,,
ID-607,article,Preferences in artificial intelligence,"The paper presents a focused survey about the presence and the use of the concept of “preferences” in Artificial Intelligence. Preferences are a central concept for decision making and have extensively been studied in disciplines such as economy, operational research, decision analysis, psychology and philosophy. However, in the recent years it has also become an important topic both for research and applications in Computer Science and more specifically in Artificial Intelligence, in fields spanning from recommender systems to automatic planning, from non monotonic reasoning to computational social choice and algorithmic decision theory. The survey essentially covers the basics of preference modelling, the use of preference in reasoning and argumentation, the problem of compact representations of preferences, preference learning and the use of non conventional preference models based on extended logical languages. It aims at providing a general reference for all researchers both in Artificial Intelligence and Decision Analysis interested in this exciting interdisciplinary topic. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84942060597&doi=10.1007%2fs10472-015-9475-5&partnerID=40&md5=1093433cbb0085cf7ab26205d1ed6ee8,3,,,,,,,G Pigozzi and A Tsoukiàs and P Viappiani,10.1007/s10472-015-9475-5,,3-4,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,,,Cited By :82,361-401,,,77,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84942060597&doi=10.1007%2fs10472-015-9475-5&partnerID=40&md5=1093433cbb0085cf7ab26205d1ed6ee8,2016,,

ID-691,article,Decision support for retirement portfolio management: Overcoming myopic loss aversion via technology design,"As firms continue to abandon pensions in favor of employee-managed retirement plans, tremendous demands are being placed on the decision-making proficiency of future retirees. As reflected in the equity premium puzzle, individual investors tend to hold overly conservative portfolios that provide meager payoffs over time. Consequently, there is growing concern that the vast majority of retirement accounts might be insufficiently funded when employees reach retirement. Given that most retirement plans can now be managed online, a potential solution lies in designing a Web-based decision support system (DSS) that helps future retirees make more-profitable portfolio management decisions. This paper reports the results of a study in which 159 retirement plan participants were asked to use an experimental website to manage a portfolio of retirement investments over a simulated 30-year period. Using a psychological approach toward designing the DSS, myopic loss aversion is put forth as a theoretical explanation for the psychological mechanisms that encourage investors to hold overly conservative portfolios. Armed with this knowledge, three design features-information horizon, system restrictiveness, and decisional guidance-are implemented as part of an overarching design strategy targeted at increasing investors' willingness to take calculated risks. The results indicate that investor conservatism diminishes when the DSS presents prospective probabilities and payoffs over long time horizons. In contrast, short-term information horizons constitute a major stumbling block for investors. However, when confronted with short-term information horizons, risk aversion can be successfully counteracted by configuring a DSS to either restrict the frequency of decisions or to suggest a relatively aggressive portfolio allocation. These findings carry important implications for theory and practice. © 2009 INFORMS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70350308040&doi=10.1287%2fmnsc.1090.1052&partnerID=40&md5=e84f4e22d9824bc50ea904b21e2beaaa,3,,,,,,,C A Looney and A M Hardin,10.1287/mnsc.1090.1052,,10,Management Science,,,Cited By :42,1688-1703,,,55,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-70350308040&doi=10.1287%2fmnsc.1090.1052&partnerID=40&md5=e84f4e22d9824bc50ea904b21e2beaaa,2009,,

ID-717,article,Artificial intelligence and formalisms for legal evidence: an introduction,"Whereas the application of artificial intelligence to law has been an active field of investigation for nearly three decades, legal evidence almost hasn't featured among such applications. A critical mass of research in this narrower field has only come into acknowledged existence after coordination initiatives (journal special issues as well as workshops) were undertaken for the very purpose of either bootstrapping the emergence of this subarea within “AI & Law,” or then to wean the extant debate among legal theorists from its exclusive focus on probabilities in law. In this introductory article to the present special issue, we take a walk through various foci for debate which are relevant for a better appreciation of the state of the art. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2442459974&doi=10.1080%2f08839510490279852&partnerID=40&md5=a7c9922e5fa5418b7d11e832da816002,3,,,,,,,E Nissan and A A Martino,10.1080/08839510490279852,,3-4,Applied Artificial Intelligence,,,Cited By :10,185-229,,,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2442459974&doi=10.1080%2f08839510490279852&partnerID=40&md5=a7c9922e5fa5418b7d11e832da816002,2004,,

ID-754,article,Artificial intelligence and subjective experience,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the scientific study of occurrent and dispositional mentation with a view to providing adequate computational models of the mind. As a science, AI is committed to an objective, third-person verifiable account of reality. If, however, there are aspects of our mentation that are irreducibly non-physical and subjective, then those aspects are forever closed to any computational model of the mind; and AI is in principle doomed. This, to my mind, is the most serious objection to AI. In this essay, I consider the objection and suggest how to respond to it.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029226614&partnerID=40&md5=80fc96abf9ca4d147309ec40e4a6fe51,4,,,,,,not an empirical article,Leke Adeofe,,,,Southcon Conference Record,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,403-408,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029226614&partnerID=40&md5=80fc96abf9ca4d147309ec40e4a6fe51,1995,,

ID-760,article,Intelligent tutoring systems: an overview,"This is a non-expert overview of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), a way in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are being applied to education. It introduces ITSs and the motivation for them. It looks at its history: its evolution from Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI). After looking at the structure of a 'typical' ITS, the paper further examines and discusses some other architectures. Several classic ITSs are reviewed, mainly due to their historical significance or because they best demonstrate some of the principles of intelligent tutoring. A reasonably representative list of ITSs is also provided in order to provide a better appreciation of this vibrant field as well as reveal the scope of existing tutors. The paper concludes, perhaps more appropriately, with some of the author's viewpoints on a couple of controversial issues in the intelligent tutoring domain. © 1990 Inteliest Ltd.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000064740&doi=10.1007%2fBF00168958&partnerID=40&md5=c54692218d5c6d80b38ebbaf7ec94b43,3,,,,,,,H S Nwana,10.1007/BF00168958,,4,Artificial Intelligence Review,,,Cited By :238,251-277,,,4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000064740&doi=10.1007%2fBF00168958&partnerID=40&md5=c54692218d5c6d80b38ebbaf7ec94b43,1990,,

ID-771,article,Algorithm directed care by nonphysician practitioners in a pediatric population:Part i adherence to algorithm logic and reproducibility of nonphysician practitioner data-gathering behavior,"The ability of quickly trained nonphysician practitioners to care for pediatric patients with upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) was evaluated in 3802 patients. These nonphysician practitioners (Army Pamosists) used an explicit treatment protocol and computerized audit of protocol adherence. Pamosists omitted protocol-suggested plans in 3.7 per cent of cases and ordered unnecessary treatment plans in 1.7 per cent of cases. They did not obtain a suggested MD consultation in 6.2 per cent of the cases. Agreement between Pamosists and pediatricians on data and management decisions (PM-MD study) was then compared with agreement on the same variables between pairs of a group of five pediatricians who saw a separate but comparable group of 103 pediatric URI patients (MD-MD study). The Pamosists demonstrated good (77 to 89 per cent) overall agreement with pediatricians, and the amounts of agreement between Pamosists and pediatricians in the PM-MD study did not generally differ significantly (p > 0.05) from the agreement on the same variables between pairs of pediatricians in the MD-MD study. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0020636805&doi=10.1097%2f00005650-198302000-00001&partnerID=40&md5=b748f6ca4cfc9c725cdc36091171fff7,3,,,,,,,F P Wilson and L O Wilson and M F Wheeler and L Canales and R W Wood,10.1097/00005650-198302000-00001,,2,Medical Care,,,Cited By :3,127-137,,,21,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0020636805&doi=10.1097%2f00005650-198302000-00001&partnerID=40&md5=b748f6ca4cfc9c725cdc36091171fff7,1983,,

ID-781,article,Exploring the potential of ChatGPT in medical dialogue summarization: a study on consistency with human preferences,"Background: Telemedicine has experienced rapid growth in recent years, aiming to enhance medical efficiency and reduce the workload of healthcare professionals. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, it became especially crucial, enabling remote screenings and access to healthcare services while maintaining social distancing. Online consultation platforms have emerged, but the demand has strained the availability of medical professionals, directly leading to research and development in automated medical consultation. Specifically, there is a need for efficient and accurate medical dialogue summarization algorithms to condense lengthy conversations into shorter versions focused on relevant medical facts. The success of large language models like generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-3 has recently prompted a paradigm shift in natural language processing (NLP) research. In this paper, we will explore its impact on medical dialogue summarization. Methods: We present the performance and evaluation results of two approaches on a medical dialogue dataset. The first approach is based on fine-tuned pre-trained language models, such as bert-based summarization (BERTSUM) and bidirectional auto-regressive Transformers (BART). The second approach utilizes a large language models (LLMs) GPT-3.5 with inter-context learning (ICL). Evaluation is conducted using automated metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore. Results: In comparison to the BART and ChatGPT models, the summaries generated by the BERTSUM model not only exhibit significantly lower ROUGE and BERTScore values but also fail to pass the testing for any of the metrics in manual evaluation. On the other hand, the BART model achieved the highest ROUGE and BERTScore values among all evaluated models, surpassing ChatGPT. Its ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and BERTScore values were 14.94%, 53.48%, 32.84%, and 6.73% higher respectively than ChatGPT’s best results. However, in the manual evaluation by medical experts, the summaries generated by the BART model exhibit satisfactory performance only in the “Readability” metric, with less than 30% passing the manual evaluation in other metrics. When compared to the BERTSUM and BART models, the ChatGPT model was evidently more favored by human medical experts. Conclusion: On one hand, the GPT-3.5 model can manipulate the style and outcomes of medical dialogue summaries through various prompts. The generated content is not only better received than results from certain human experts but also more comprehensible, making it a promising avenue for automated medical dialogue summarization. On the other hand, automated evaluation mechanisms like ROUGE and BERTScore fall short in fully assessing the outputs of large language models like GPT-3.5. Therefore, it is necessary to research more appropriate evaluation criteria. © The Author(s) 2024.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12911-024-02481-8?utm_source=getftr&utm_medium=getftr&utm_campaign=getftr_pilot,3,,,,,,,Y Liu and S Ju and J Wang,10.1186/s12911-024-02481-8,,1,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187877038&doi=10.1186%2fs12911-024-02481-8&partnerID=40&md5=a93f6c65796320b1f73e95678a0e8a58,2024,,

ID-783,article,Evaluating ChatGPT's moral competence in health care-related ethical problems,"Objectives: Artificial intelligence tools such as Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) have been used for many health care-related applications; however, there is a lack of research on their capabilities for evaluating morally and/or ethically complex medical decisions. The objective of this study was to assess the moral competence of ChatGPT. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was performed between May 2023 and July 2023 using scenarios from the Moral Competence Test (MCT). Numerical responses were collected from ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0 to assess individual and overall stage scores, including C-index and overall moral stage preference. Descriptive analysis and 2-sided Student's t-test were used for all continuous data. Results: A total of 100 iterations of the MCT were performed and moral preference was found to be higher in the latter Kohlberg-derived arguments. ChatGPT 4.0 was found to have a higher overall moral stage preference (2.325 versus 1.755) when compared to ChatGPT 3.5. ChatGPT 4.0 was also found to have a statistically higher C-index score in comparison to ChatGPT 3.5 (29.03 ± 11.10 versus 19.32 ± 10.95, P ¼.0000275). Discussion: ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0 trended towards higher moral preference for the latter stages of Kohlberg's theory for both dilemmas with Cindices suggesting medium moral competence. However, both models showed moderate variation in C-index scores indicating inconsistency and further training is recommended. Conclusion: ChatGPT demonstrates medium moral competence and can evaluate arguments based on Kohlberg's theory of moral development. These findings suggest that future revisions of ChatGPT and other large language models could assist physicians in the decision-making process when encountering complex ethical scenarios. © The Author(s) 2024.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198245587&doi=10.1093%2fjamiaopen%2fooae065&partnerID=40&md5=fc9e20daf221de23e98269cfa5e41efd,3,,,,,,,A A Rashid and R A Skelly and C A Valdes and P P Patel and L B Solberg and C R Giordano and F Modave,10.1093/jamiaopen/ooae065,,3,JAMIA Open,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198245587&doi=10.1093%2fjamiaopen%2fooae065&partnerID=40&md5=fc9e20daf221de23e98269cfa5e41efd,2024,,

ID-786,article,Perils and opportunities in using large language models in psychological research,"The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has sparked considerable interest in their potential application in psychological research, mainly as a model of the human psyche or as a general text-analysis tool. However, the trend of using LLMs without sufficient attention to their limitations and risks, which we rhetorically refer to as “GPTology”, can be detrimental given the easy access to models such as ChatGPT. Beyond existing general guidelines, we investigate the current limitations, ethical implications, and potential of LLMs specifically for psychological research, and show their concrete impact in various empirical studies. Our results highlight the importance of recognizing global psychological diversity, cautioning against treating LLMs (especially in zero-shot settings) as universal solutions for text analysis, and developing transparent, open methods to address LLMs’ opaque nature for reliable, reproducible, and robust inference from AI-generated data. Acknowledging LLMs’ utility for task automation, such as text annotation, or to expand our understanding of human psychology, we argue for diversifying human samples and expanding psychology’s methodological toolbox to promote an inclusive, generalizable science, countering homogenization, and over-reliance on LLMs. © The Author(s) 2024.",https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/7/pgae245/7712371,3,,,,,,interesting overview of overreliance on LLMs in psychological research,S Abdurahman and M Atari and F Karimi-Malekabadi and M J Xue and J Trager and P S Park and P Golazizian and A Omrani and M Dehghani,10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae245,,7,PNAS Nexus,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198967961&doi=10.1093%2fpnasnexus%2fpgae245&partnerID=40&md5=ee1b5bb438ad4faa091d5fa19845708d,2024,,

ID-794,article,Augmenting Human Teams with Robots in Knowledge Work Settings: Insights from the Literature,"Recent developments in large language models open doors for Artificial Intelligence and robots to augment knowledge workers and teams in a variety of domains, such as customer service, data science, legal work, and software development. In this article, we review 317 articles from multiple disciplines and summarize the insights in a theoretical framework linking key robot attributes to human perceptions and behaviors. The robot attributes include embodiment, nonverbal and verbal communication, perceived gender and race, emotions, perceived personality, and competence. The outcomes include human perceptions, acceptance, engagement, compliance, trust, and willingness to help. We identify four differences between one human and one robot settings and team settings and use them as the springboard to generalize insights from the literature review to the design and impact of a robot in assisting humans in knowledge work teams. We report two high-level observations around the interplay among robot attributes and context dependent designs and discuss their implications. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

ID-800,article,Beyond the Front Yard: The Dehumanizing Message of Accent-Altering Technology,"Over the past decade, the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, as it relates to the speech and voice recognition industry, has established itself as a multibillion-dollar global market, but at whose expense? In this forum article, we amplify the current critiques of the architectures of large language models being used increasingly in daily life. Our commentary exposes emerging AI accent modification technology and services as agents of racial commodification and linguistic dominance, as it rests on the perceived superiority of standardized US English. We discuss our concern for such services leaching into academia. We argue that this technology follows a standardized language framework, which poses a fundamental problem of being informed by purist monolingual principles. These principles often help to perpetuate and maintain harmful raciolinguistic ideologies that result in language discrimination and the continual framing of the language practices of racially minoritized speakers as deficient. Thus, we write this piece with the intent to expose the fabricated humanity of accent modification technology whose existence perpetuates capitalism's reliance on dehumanization for economic advancement and the legacy and reproduction of white language superiority. © 2024 The Author(s) (2024).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193957174&doi=10.1093%2fapplin%2famae002&partnerID=40&md5=865de1bd50fea3a43468a37546563e7f,3,,,,,,,A L Payne and T Austin and A M Clemons,10.1093/applin/amae002,,3,Applied Linguistics,,,Cited By :2,553-560,,,45,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193957174&doi=10.1093%2fapplin%2famae002&partnerID=40&md5=865de1bd50fea3a43468a37546563e7f,2024,,
ID-801,article,University students’ self-reported reliance on ChatGPT for learning: A latent profile analysis,"Although ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art, large language model, seems to be a disruptive technology in higher education, it is unclear to what extent students rely on this tool for completing different tasks. To address this gap, we asked university students (N = 490) recruited via CloudResearch to rate the extent to which they rely on ChatGPT for completing 13 tasks identified in a previous pilot study. Five distinct profiles emerged: ‘Versatile low reliers’ (38.2%) were characterised by low overall self-reported reliance across the tasks, while ‘all-rounders’ (10.4%) had high overall self-reported reliance. The ‘knowledge seekers’ (16.5%) scored particularly high on tasks such as content acquisition, information retrieval and summarising of texts, while the ‘proactive learners’ (11.8%) on tasks such as obtaining feedback, planning and quizzing. Finally, the ‘assignment delegators’ (23.1%) relied on ChatGPT for drafting assignments, writing homework and having ChatGPT write their assignment for them. The findings provide a nuanced understanding of how students rely on ChatGPT for learning. © 2024 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193441983&doi=10.1016%2fj.caeai.2024.100243&partnerID=40&md5=c6e4762c0d09c9aeea4084714e6a2d26,3,,,,,,,A Stojanov and Q Liu and J H L Koh,10.1016/j.caeai.2024.100243,,,Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193441983&doi=10.1016%2fj.caeai.2024.100243&partnerID=40&md5=c6e4762c0d09c9aeea4084714e6a2d26,2024,,

ID-805,article,The role of artificial intelligence in informed patient consent for radiotherapy treatments—a case report,"Recent advancements in large language models (LMM; e.g., ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, California, USA)) have seen widespread use in various fields, including healthcare. This case study reports on the first use of LMM in a pretreatment discussion and in obtaining informed consent for a radiation oncology treatment. Further, the reproducibility of the replies by ChatGPT 3.5 was analyzed. A breast cancer patient, following legal consultation, engaged in a conversation with ChatGPT 3.5 regarding her radiotherapy treatment. The patient posed questions about side effects, prevention, activities, medications, and late effects. While some answers contained inaccuracies, responses closely resembled doctors’ replies. In a final evaluation discussion, the patient, however, stated that she preferred the presence of a physician and expressed concerns about the source of the provided information. The reproducibility was tested in ten iterations. Future guidelines for using such models in radiation oncology should be driven by medical professionals. While artificial intelligence (AI) supports essential tasks, human interaction remains crucial. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2024.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00066-023-02190-7,3,,,,,,,M Moll and G Heilemann and D Georg and D Kauer-Dorner and P Kuess,10.1007/s00066-023-02190-7,,6,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie,,,Cited By :1,544-548,,,200,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181445716&doi=10.1007%2fs00066-023-02190-7&partnerID=40&md5=36a565c278c203e389df4b72255ba34d,2024,,

ID-812,article,Beyond the Books: Exploring Factors Shaping Chinese English Learners’ Engagement with Large Language Models for Vocabulary Learning,"Informal English learning plays a crucial role in vocabulary learning, yet few scholars have explored the use of large language models for this purpose. In light of this, our study, integrating Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to investigate factors influencing 568 Chinese English learners’ use of large language models for vocabulary learning. Our findings identified six significant factors from those models—perceived autonomy, perceived competence, perceived relatedness, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence—that significantly shape learners’ intentions and behaviors towards utilizing large language models for vocabulary learning. Notably, effort expectancy emerged as the most influential factor, while facilitating conditions did not significantly impact usage intentions. This research offers insights for future curriculum design and policy formulation, highlighting the importance of understanding learners’ perspectives on technology use in education. © 2024 by the authors.",https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/14/5/496,3,,,,,,"SEM, structural equation modeling, informed by self-determination theory and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology",X Wang and B L Reynolds,10.3390/educsci14050496,,5,Education Sciences,,,Cited By :5,,,,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194244342&doi=10.3390%2feducsci14050496&partnerID=40&md5=f5d9e5da525e7cc47b0423c8a9e973ae,2024,,

ID-821,article,MetaWriter: Exploring the Potential and Perils of AI Writing Support in Scientific Peer Review,"Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show the potential to significantly augment or even replace complex human writing activities. However, for complex tasks where people need to make decisions as well as write a justification, the trade offs between making work efficient and hindering decisions remain unclear. In this paper, we explore this question in the context of designing intelligent scaffolding for writing meta-reviews for an academic peer review process. We prototyped a system called “MetaWriter” trained on five years of open peer review data to support meta-reviewing. The system highlights common topics in the original peer reviews, extracts key points by each reviewer, and on request, provides a preliminary draft of a meta-review that can be further edited. To understand how novice and experienced meta-reviewers use MetaWriter, we conducted a within-subject study with 32 participants. Each participant wrote meta-reviews for two papers: one with and one without MetaWriter. We found that MetaWriter significantly expedited the authoring process and improved the coverage of meta-reviews, as rated by experts, compared to the baseline. While participants recognized the efficiency benefits, they raised concerns around trust, over-reliance, and agency. We also interviewed six paper authors to understand their opinions of using machine intelligence to support the peer review process and reported critical reflections. We discuss implications for future interactive AI writing tools to support complex synthesis work. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

ID-822,article,Towards human-centred standards for legal help AI,"As more groups consider how AI may be used in the legal sector, this paper envisions how companies and policymakers can prioritize the perspective of community members as they design AI and policies around it. It presents findings of structured interviews and design sessions with community members, in which they were asked about whether, how, and why they would use AI tools powered by large language models to respond to legal problems like receiving an eviction notice. The respondents reviewed options for simple versus complex interfaces for AI tools, and expressed how they would want to engage with an AI tool to resolve a legal problem. These empirical findings provide directions that can counterbalance legal domain experts' proposals about the public interest around AI, as expressed by attorneys, court officials, advocates and regulators. By hearing directly from community members about how they want to use AI for civil justice tasks, what risks concern them, and the value they would find in different kinds of AI tools, this research can ensure that people's points of view are understood and prioritized, rather than only domain experts' assertions about people's needs and preferences around legal help AI.

ID-829,article,Factors affecting performance expectancy and intentions to use ChatGPT: Using SmartPLS to advance an information technology acceptance framework,"Few studies have explored the use of artificial intelligence-enabled (AI-enabled) large language models (LLMs). This research addresses this knowledge gap. It investigates perceptions and intentional behaviors to utilize AI dialogue systems like Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT). A survey questionnaire comprising measures from key information technology adoption models, was used to capture quantitative data from a sample of 654 respondents. A partial least squares (PLS) approach assesses the constructs' reliabilities and validities. It also identifies the relative strength and significance of the causal paths in the proposed research model. The findings from SmartPLS4 report that there are highly significant effects in this empirical investigation particularly between source trustworthiness and performance expectancy from AI chatbots, as well as between perceived interactivity and intentions to use this algorithm, among others. In conclusion, this contribution puts forward a robust information technology acceptance framework that clearly evidences the factors that entice online users to habitually engage with text-generating AI chatbot technologies. It implies that although they may be considered as useful interactive systems for content creators, there is scope to continue improving the quality of their responses (in terms of their accuracy and timeliness) to reduce misinformation, social biases, hallucinations and adversarial prompts. © 2024 The Author(s)",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004016252400043X?pes=vor,1,1,1,,,,Table 1 has an overview of the various theories that attempt to explain people's willingness to adopt technologies.,M A Camilleri,10.1016/j.techfore.2024.123247,,,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,,,Cited By :8,,,,201,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183980582&doi=10.1016%2fj.techfore.2024.123247&partnerID=40&md5=c0eab33e3f02c3f59d1c41b6c598d48b,2024,,

ID-839,article,The moral machine experiment on large language models,"As large language models (LLMs) have become more deeply integrated into various sectors, understanding how they make moral judgements has become crucial, particularly in the realm of autonomous driving. This study used the moral machine framework to investigate the ethical decision-making tendencies of prominent LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM 2 and Llama 2, to compare their responses with human preferences. While LLMs’ and humans’ preferences such as prioritizing humans over pets and favouring saving more lives are broadly aligned, PaLM 2 and Llama 2, especially, evidence distinct deviations. Additionally, despite the qualitative similarities between the LLM and human preferences, there are significant quantitative disparities, suggesting that LLMs might lean toward more uncompromising decisions, compared with the milder inclinations of humans. These insights elucidate the ethical frameworks of LLMs and their potential implications for autonomous driving. © 2024 Royal Society Publishing.

ID-847,article,"The Impact of Performance Expectancy, Workload, Risk, and Satisfaction on Trust in ChatGPT: Cross-Sectional Survey Analysis","Background: ChatGPT (OpenAI) is a powerful tool for a wide range of tasks, from entertainment and creativity to health care queries. There are potential risks and benefits associated with this technology. In the discourse concerning the deployment of ChatGPT and similar large language models, it is sensible to recommend their use primarily for tasks a human user can execute accurately. As we transition into the subsequent phase of ChatGPT deployment, establishing realistic performance expectations and understanding users' perceptions of risk associated with its use are crucial in determining the successful integration of this artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Objective: The aim of the study is to explore how perceived workload, satisfaction, performance expectancy, and risk-benefit perception influence users' trust in ChatGPT. Methods: A semistructured, web-based survey was conducted with 607 adults in the United States who actively use ChatGPT. The survey questions were adapted from constructs used in various models and theories such as the technology acceptance model, the theory of planned behavior, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, and research on trust and security in digital environments. To test our hypotheses and structural model, we used the partial least squares structural equation modeling method, a widely used approach for multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 607 people responded to our survey. A significant portion of the participants held at least a high school diploma (n=204, 33.6%), and the majority had a bachelor's degree (n=262, 43.1%). The primary motivations for participants to use ChatGPT were for acquiring information (n=219, 36.1%), amusement (n=203, 33.4%), and addressing problems (n=135, 22.2%). Some participants used it for health-related inquiries (n=44, 7.2%), while a few others (n=6, 1%) used it for miscellaneous activities such as brainstorming, grammar verification, and blog content creation. Our model explained 64.6% of the variance in trust. Our analysis indicated a significant relationship between (1) workload and satisfaction, (2) trust and satisfaction, (3) performance expectations and trust, and (4) risk-benefit perception and trust. Conclusions: The findings underscore the importance of ensuring user-friendly design and functionality in AI-based applications to reduce workload and enhance user satisfaction, thereby increasing user trust. Future research should further explore the relationship between risk-benefit perception and trust in the context of AI chatbots. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

ID-848,article,Trust but Verify: Lessons Learned for the Application of AI to Case-Based Clinical Decision-Making From Postmarketing Drug Safety Assessment at the US Food and Drug Administration,"Adverse drug reactions are a common cause of morbidity in health care. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluates individual case safety reports of adverse events (AEs) after submission to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System as part of its surveillance activities. Over the past decade, the FDA has explored the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate these reports to improve the efficiency and scientific rigor of the process. However, a gap remains between AI algorithm development and deployment. This viewpoint aims to describe the lessons learned from our experience and research needed to address both general issues in case-based reasoning using AI and specific needs for individual case safety report assessment. Beginning with the recognition that the trustworthiness of the AI algorithm is the main determinant of its acceptance by human experts, we apply the Diffusion of Innovations theory to help explain why certain algorithms for evaluating AEs at the FDA were accepted by safety reviewers and others were not. This analysis reveals that the process by which clinicians decide from case reports whether a drug is likely to cause an AE is not well defined beyond general principles. This makes the development of high performing, transparent, and explainable AI algorithms challenging, leading to a lack of trust by the safety reviewers. Even accounting for the introduction of large language models, the pharmacovigilance community needs an improved understanding of causal inference and of the cognitive framework for determining the causal relationship between a drug and an AE. We describe specific future research directions that underpin facilitating implementation and trust in AI for drug safety applications, including improved methods for measuring and controlling of algorithmic uncertainty, computational reproducibility, and clear articulation of a cognitive framework for causal inference in case-based reasoning. © Robert Ball, Andrew H Talal, Oanh Dang, Monica Muñoz, Marianthi Markatou.",https://www.jmir.org/2024/1/e50274,3,,,,,,,R Ball and A H Talal and O Dang and M Muñoz and M Markatou,10.2196/50274,,1,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195333916&doi=10.2196%2f50274&partnerID=40&md5=24a7d3ce88bd5205e075a471d95c04fc,2024,,

ID-854,article,Physician Versus Large Language Model Chatbot Responses to Web-Based Questions From Autistic Patients in Chinese: Cross-Sectional Comparative Analysis,"Background: There is a dearth of feasibility assessments regarding using large language models (LLMs) for responding to inquiries from autistic patients within a Chinese-language context. Despite Chinese being one of the most widely spoken languages globally, the predominant research focus on applying these models in the medical field has been on English-speaking populations. Objective: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of LLM chatbots, specifically ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI) and ERNIE Bot (version 2.2.3; Baidu, Inc), one of the most advanced LLMs in China, in addressing inquiries from autistic individuals in a Chinese setting. Methods: For this study, we gathered data from DXY—a widely acknowledged, web-based, medical consultation platform in China with a user base of over 100 million individuals. A total of 100 patient consultation samples were rigorously selected from January 2018 to August 2023, amounting to 239 questions extracted from publicly available autism-related documents on the platform. To maintain objectivity, both the original questions and responses were anonymized and randomized. An evaluation team of 3 chief physicians assessed the responses across 4 dimensions: relevance, accuracy, usefulness, and empathy. The team completed 717 evaluations. The team initially identified the best response and then used a Likert scale with 5 response categories to gauge the responses, each representing a distinct level of quality. Finally, we compared the responses collected from different sources. Results: Among the 717 evaluations conducted, 46.86% (95% CI 43.21%-50.51%) of assessors displayed varying preferences for responses from physicians, with 34.87% (95% CI 31.38%-38.36%) of assessors favoring ChatGPT and 18.27% (95% CI 15.44%-21.10%) of assessors favoring ERNIE Bot. The average relevance scores for physicians, ChatGPT, and ERNIE Bot were 3.75 (95% CI 3.69-3.82), 3.69 (95% CI 3.63-3.74), and 3.41 (95% CI 3.35-3.46), respectively. Physicians (3.66, 95% CI 3.60-3.73) and ChatGPT (3.73, 95% CI 3.69-3.77) demonstrated higher accuracy ratings compared to ERNIE Bot (3.52, 95% CI 3.47-3.57). In terms of usefulness scores, physicians (3.54, 95% CI 3.47-3.62) received higher ratings than ChatGPT (3.40, 95% CI 3.34-3.47) and ERNIE Bot (3.05, 95% CI 2.99-3.12). Finally, concerning the empathy dimension, ChatGPT (3.64, 95% CI 3.57-3.71) outperformed physicians (3.13, 95% CI 3.04-3.21) and ERNIE Bot (3.11, 95% CI 3.04-3.18). Conclusions: In this cross-sectional study, physicians’ responses exhibited superiority in the present Chinese-language context. Nonetheless, LLMs can provide valuable medical guidance to autistic patients and may even surpass physicians in demonstrating empathy. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that further optimization and research are imperative prerequisites before the effective integration of LLMs in clinical settings across diverse linguistic environments can be realized. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

ID-856,article,Quality of Answers of Generative Large Language Models Versus Peer Users for Interpreting Laboratory Test Results for Lay Patients: Evaluation Study,"Background: Although patients have easy access to their electronic health records and laboratory test result data through patient portals, laboratory test results are often confusing and hard to understand. Many patients turn to web-based forums or question-and-answer (Q&A) sites to seek advice from their peers. The quality of answers from social Q&A sites on health-related questions varies significantly, and not all responses are accurate or reliable. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have opened a promising avenue for patients to have their questions answered. Objective: We aimed to assess the feasibility of using LLMs to generate relevant, accurate, helpful, and unharmful responses to laboratory test–related questions asked by patients and identify potential issues that can be mitigated using augmentation approaches. Methods: We collected laboratory test result–related Q&A data from Yahoo! Answers and selected 53 Q&A pairs for this study. Using the LangChain framework and ChatGPT web portal, we generated responses to the 53 questions from 5 LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, LLaMA 2, MedAlpaca, and ORCA_mini. We assessed the similarity of their answers using standard Q&A similarity-based evaluation metrics, including Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, Metric for Evaluation of Translation With Explicit Ordering, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Score. We used an LLM-based evaluator to judge whether a target model had higher quality in terms of relevance, correctness, helpfulness, and safety than the baseline model. We performed a manual evaluation with medical experts for all the responses to 7 selected questions on the same 4 aspects. Results: Regarding the similarity of the responses from 4 LLMs; the GPT-4 output was used as the reference answer, the responses from GPT-3.5 were the most similar, followed by those from LLaMA 2, ORCA_mini, and MedAlpaca. Human answers from Yahoo data were scored the lowest and, thus, as the least similar to GPT-4–generated answers. The results of the win rate and medical expert evaluation both showed that GPT-4’s responses achieved better scores than all the other LLM responses and human responses on all 4 aspects (relevance, correctness, helpfulness, and safety). LLM responses occasionally also suffered from lack of interpretation in one’s medical context, incorrect statements, and lack of references. Conclusions: By evaluating LLMs in generating responses to patients’ laboratory test result–related questions, we found that, compared to other 4 LLMs and human answers from a Q&A website, GPT-4’s responses were more accurate, helpful, relevant, and safer. There were cases in which GPT-4 responses were inaccurate and not individualized. We identified a number of ways to improve the quality of LLM responses, including prompt engineering, prompt augmentation, retrieval-augmented generation, and response evaluation. ©Zhe He, Balu Bhasuran, Qiao Jin, Shubo Tian, Karim Hanna, Cindy Shavor, Lisbeth Garcia Arguello, Patrick Murray, Zhiyong Lu.",https://www.jmir.org/2024/1/e56655,1,1,1,medical,,,,Z He and B Bhasuran and Q Jin and S Tian and K Hanna and C Shavor and L G Arguello and P Murray and Z Lu,10.2196/56655,,1,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,,Export Date: 30 July 2024,,,,26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190903860&doi=10.2196%2f56655&partnerID=40&md5=9c881f6e5332fef0799c9f9e46b2f9fb,2024,,

ID-859,article,"Receive, Reason, and React: Drive as You Say, With Large Language Models in Autonomous Vehicles","The fusion of human-centric design and artificial intelligence capabilities has opened up new possibilities for next-generation autonomous vehicles that go beyond traditional transportation. These vehicles can dynamically interact with passengers and adapt to their preferences. This article proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the decision-making process in autonomous vehicles. By utilizing LLMs' contextual understanding abilities with specialized tools, we aim to integrate the language and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into autonomous vehicles. Our research includes experiments in HighwayEnv, a collection of environments for autonomous driving and tactical decision-making tasks, to explore LLMs' interpretation, interaction, and reasoning in various scenarios. We also examine some well-defined real-time personalized driving tasks, demonstrating how LLMs can influence driving behaviors based on drivers' verbal commands. Our empirical results highlight the substantial advantages of utilizing chain-of-thought prompting, leading to improved driving decisions and showing the potential for LLMs to enhance personalized driving experiences through ongoing verbal feedback. The proposed framework aims to transform autonomous vehicle operations, offering personalized support, transparent decision making, and continuous learning to enhance safety and effectiveness. We achieve user-centric, transparent, and adaptive autonomous driving ecosystems supported by the integration of LLMs into autonomous vehicles.

ID-860,article,User acceptance and adoption dynamics of ChatGPT in educational settings,"Recent developments in natural language understanding have sparked a great amount of interest in the large language models such as ChatGPT that contain billions of parameters and are trained for thousands of hours on all the textual data of the internet. ChatGPT has received immense attention because it has widespread applications, which it is able to do out-of-the-box, with no prior training or fine-tuning. These models show emergent skill and can perform virtually any textual task and provide glimmers, or “sparks”, of artificial general intelligence, in the form of a general problem solver as envisioned by Newell and Simon in the early days of artificial intelligence research. Researchers are now exploring the opportunities of ChatGPT in education. Yet, the factors influencing and driving users’ acceptance of ChatGPT remains largely unexplored. This study investigates users’ (n=138) acceptance of ChatGPT. We test a structural model developed using Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model. The study reveals that performance expectancy is related to behavioral intention, which in turn is related to ChatGPT use. Findings are discussed within the context of mass adoption and the challenges and opportunities for teaching and learning. The findings provide empirical grounding to support understanding of technology acceptance decisions through the lens of students’ use of ChatGPT and further document the influence of situational factors on technology acceptance more broadly. This research contributes to body of knowledge and facilitates future research on digital innovation acceptance and use. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

ID-866,article,Exploring EFL university teachers’ beliefs in integrating ChatGPT and other large language models in language education: a study in China,"Nowadays, the prevalence of ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) has posed significant challenges into the education field, particularly in English education. In response, this study aimed to investigate the beliefs of 95 EFL university teachers from Chinese universities regarding the integration of LLMs in language education, as well as the relationships between their beliefs and other factors. The study yielded several findings: (1) According to the quantitative and qualitative results, we revealed several concerns among Chinese EFL university teachers regarding LLMs integration, such as neglection of traditional learning resources, academic integrity, and excessive reliance. (2) Previous experiences with LLMs, frequency of LLMs use, and self-evaluation on stages of LLMs integration all played vital roles in shaping university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education. (3) No significant correlation was observed between university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education and the availability of IT personnel.

ID-867,article,A Personalized Patient Preference Predictor for Substituted Judgments in Healthcare: Technically Feasible and Ethically Desirable,"When making substituted judgments for incapacitated patients, surrogates often struggle to guess what the patient would want if they had capacity. Surrogates may also agonize over having the (sole) responsibility of making such a determination. To address such concerns, a Patient Preference Predictor (PPP) has been proposed that would use an algorithm to infer the treatment preferences of individual patients from population-level data about the known preferences of people with similar demographic characteristics. However, critics have suggested that even if such a PPP were more accurate, on average, than human surrogates in identifying patient preferences, the proposed algorithm would nevertheless fail to respect the patient’s (former) autonomy since it draws on the ‘wrong’ kind of data: namely, data that are not specific to the individual patient and which therefore may not reflect their actual values, or their reasons for having the preferences they do. Taking such criticisms on board, we here propose a new approach: the Personalized Patient Preference Predictor (P4). The P4 is based on recent advances in machine learning, which allow technologies including large language models to be more cheaply and efficiently ‘fine-tuned’ on person-specific data. The P4, unlike the PPP, would be able to infer an individual patient’s preferences from material (e.g., prior treatment decisions) that is in fact specific to them. Thus, we argue, in addition to being potentially more accurate at the individual level than the previously proposed PPP, the predictions of a P4 would also more directly reflect each patient’s own reasons and values. In this article, we review recent discoveries in artificial intelligence research that suggest a P4 is technically feasible, and argue that, if it is developed and appropriately deployed, it should assuage some of the main autonomy-based concerns of critics of the original PPP. We then consider various objections to our proposal and offer some tentative replies. © 2024 The Author(s).

ID-879,article,AI-generated feedback on writing: insights into efficacy and ENL student preference,"The question of how generative AI tools, such as large language models and chatbots, can be leveraged ethically and effectively in education is ongoing. Given the critical role that writing plays in learning and assessment within educational institutions, it is of growing importance for educators to make thoughtful and informed decisions as to how and in what capacity generative AI tools should be leveraged to assist in the development of students’ writing skills. This paper reports on two longitudinal studies. Study 1 examined learning outcomes of 48 university English as a new language (ENL) learners in a six-week long repeated measures quasi experimental design where the experimental group received writing feedback generated from ChatGPT (GPT-4) and the control group received feedback from their human tutor. Study 2 analyzed the perceptions of a different group of 43 ENLs who received feedback from both ChatGPT and their tutor. Results of study 1 showed no difference in learning outcomes between the two groups. Study 2 results revealed a near even split in preference for AI-generated or human-generated feedback, with clear advantages to both forms of feedback apparent from the data. The main implication of these studies is that the use of AI-generated feedback can likely be incorporated into ENL essay evaluation without affecting learning outcomes, although we recommend a blended approach that utilizes the strengths of both forms of feedback. The main contribution of this paper is in addressing generative AI as an automatic essay evaluator while incorporating learner perspectives. © 2023, The Author(s).",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41239-023-00425-2?utm_source=getftr&utm_medium=getftr&utm_campaign=getftr_pilot,1,1,1,education,,,1.

ID-892,article,Using ChatGPT and Persuasive Technology for Personalized Recommendation Messages in Hotel Upselling,"Recommender systems have become indispensable tools in the hotel hospitality industry, enabling personalized and tailored experiences for guests. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, and persuasive technologies have opened new avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of those systems. This paper explores the potential of integrating ChatGPT and persuasive technologies for automating and improving hotel hospitality recommender systems. First, we delve into the capabilities of ChatGPT, which can understand and generate human-like text, enabling more accurate and context-aware recommendations. We discuss the integration of ChatGPT into recommender systems, highlighting the ability to analyze user preferences, extract valuable insights from online reviews, and generate personalized recommendations based on guest profiles. Second, we investigate the role of persuasive technology in influencing user behavior and enhancing the persuasive impact of hotel recommendations. By incorporating persuasive techniques, such as social proof, scarcity, and personalization, recommender systems can effectively influence user decision making and encourage desired actions, such as booking a specific hotel or upgrading their room. To investigate the efficacy of ChatGPT and persuasive technologies, we present pilot experiments with a case study involving a hotel recommender system. Our inhouse commercial hotel marketing platform, eXclusivi, was extended with a new software module working with ChatGPT prompts and persuasive ads created for its recommendations. In particular, we developed an intelligent advertisement (ad) copy generation tool for the hotel marketing platform. The proposed approach allows for the hotel team to target all guests in their language, leveraging the integration with the hotel’s reservation system. Overall, this paper contributes to the field of hotel hospitality by exploring the synergistic relationship between ChatGPT and persuasive technology in recommender systems, ultimately influencing guest satisfaction and hotel revenue. © 2023 by the authors.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172250632&doi=10.3390%2finfo14090504&partnerID=40&md5=c930ed2acd20c0d2b46720429d5dbca4,3,,,,,,,M Remountakis and K Kotis and B Kourtzis and G E Tsekouras,10.3390/info14090504,,9,Information (Switzerland),,,Cited By :5,,,,14,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172250632&doi=10.3390%2finfo14090504&partnerID=40&md5=c930ed2acd20c0d2b46720429d5dbca4,2023,,

ID-907,article,"Human favoritism, not AI aversion: People’s perceptions (and bias) toward generative AI, human experts, and human–GAI collaboration in persuasive content generation","With the wide availability of large language models and generative AI, there are four primary paradigms for human–AI collaboration: human-only, AI-only (ChatGPT-4), augmented human (where a human makes the final decision with AI output as a reference), or augmented AI (where the AI makes the final decision with human output as a reference). In partnership with one of the world’s leading consulting firms, we enlisted professional content creators and ChatGPT-4 to create advertising content for products and persuasive content for campaigns following the aforementioned paradigms. First, we find that, contrary to the expectations of some of the existing algorithm aversion literature on conventional predictive AI, the content generated by generative AI and augmented AI is perceived as of higher quality than that produced by human experts and augmented human experts. Second, revealing the source of content production reduces—but does not reverse—the perceived quality gap between human-and AI-generated content. This bias in evaluation is predominantly driven by human favoritism rather than AI aversion: Knowing that the same content is created by a human expert increases its (reported) perceived quality, but knowing that AI is involved in the creation process does not affect its perceived quality. Further analysis suggests this bias is not due to a ‘quality prime’ as knowing the content they are about to evaluate comes from competent creators (e.g., industry professionals and state-of-the-art AI) without knowing exactly that the creator of each piece of content does not increase participants’ perceived quality. © The Author(s), 2023.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/judgment-and-decision-making/article/human-favoritism-not-ai-aversion-peoples-perceptions-and-bias-toward-generative-ai-human-experts-and-humangai-collaboration-in-persuasive-content-generation/419C4BD9CE82673EAF1D8F6C350C4FA8,1,1,1,"advertising, marketing",,," 3 (information level: baseline, partially informed, and informed) x 4 (content generation paradigms: human-only, AI-only, augmented human, or augmented AI)",Y Zhang and R Gosline,10.1017/JDM.2023.37,,,Judgment and Decision Making,,,Cited By :5,,,,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184159567&doi=10.1017%2fJDM.2023.37&partnerID=40&md5=34dd9c76d8a5052a0c85bcfc3b07bce5,2023,,

ID-1133,article,Blame the Machine? Insights From an Experiment on Algorithm Aversion and Blame Avoidance in Computer-Aided Human Resource Management ,"Algorithms have become increasingly relevant in supporting human resource (HR) management, but their application may entail psychological biases and unintended side effects on employee behavior. This study examines the effect of the type of HR decision (i.e., promoting or dismissing staff) on the likelihood of delegating these HR decisions to an algorithm-based decision support system. Based on prior research on algorithm aversion and blame avoidance, we conducted a quantitative online experiment using a 2×2 randomly controlled design with a sample of N = 288 highly educated young professionals and graduate students in Germany. This study partly replicates and substantially extends the methods and theoretical insights from a 2015 study by Dietvorst and colleagues. While we find that respondents exhibit a tendency of delegating presumably unpleasant HR tasks (i.e., dismissals) to the algorithm—rather than delegating promotions—this effect is highly conditional upon the opportunity to pretest the algorithm, as well as individuals’ level of trust in machine-based and human forecast. Respondents’ aversion to algorithms dominates blame avoidance by delegation. This study is the first to provide empirical evidence that the type of HR decision affects algorithm aversion only to a limited extent. Instead, it reveals the counterintuitive effect of algorithm pretesting and the relevance of confidence in forecast models in the context of algorithm-aided HRM, providing theoretical and practical insights.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.779028/full,1,1,1,HR management,,,,Christian Maasland and Kristina S Weißmüller,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.779028,1664-1078,,Frontiers in psychology,"algorithm aversion,algorithm-based decision support systems,behavioral experimental research,blame avoidance,human resource management",,,779028,,,13,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.779028 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35693517 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9177159,2022,Switzerland,
ID-1134,article,Robo-investment aversion,"In five experiments (N = 3,828), we investigate whether people prefer investment decisions to be made by human investment managers rather than by algorithms (“robos”). In all of the studies we investigate morally controversial companies, as it is plausible that a preference for humans as investment managers becomes exacerbated in areas where machines are less competent, such as morality. In Study 1, participants rated the permissibility of an algorithm to autonomously exclude morally controversial stocks from investment portfolios as lower than if a human fund manager did the same; this finding was not different if participants were informed that such exclusions might be financially disadvantageous for them. In Study 2, we show that this robo-investment aversion manifests itself both when considering investment in controversial and non-controversial industries. In Study 3, our findings show that robo-investment aversion is also present when algorithms are given the autonomy to increase investment in controversial stocks. In Studies 4 and 5, we investigate choices between actual humans and an algorithm. In Study 4 –which was incentivized–participants show no robo-investment aversion, but are significantly less likely to choose machines as investment managers for controversial stocks. In contrast, in Study 5 robo-investment aversion is present, but it is not different across controversial and non-controversial stocks. Overall, our findings show a considerable mean effect size for robo-investment aversion (d = –0.39 [–0.45, –0.32]). This suggests that algorithm aversion extends to the financial realm, supporting the existence of a barrier for the adoption of innovative financial technologies (FinTech).

ID-1137,article,People Reject Algorithms in Uncertain Decision Domains Because They Have Diminishing Sensitivity to Forecasting Error,"Will people use self-driving cars, virtual doctors, and other algorithmic decision-makers if they outperform humans? The answer depends on the uncertainty inherent in the decision domain. We propose that people have diminishing
sensitivity to forecasting error and that this preference results in people favoring riskier (and often worse-performing) decision-making methods, such as human judgment, in inherently uncertain domains. In nine studies (N = 4,820), we found that (a) people have diminishing sensitivity to each marginal unit of error that a forecast produces, (b) people are less likely to use the best possible algorithm in decision domains that are more unpredictable, (c) people choose between decision-making methods on the basis of the perceived likelihood of those methods producing a near-perfect answer, and (d) people prefer methods that exhibit higher variance in performance (all else being equal). To the extent that investing, medical decision-making, and other domains are inherently uncertain, people may be unwilling to use even the best possible algorithm in those domains.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797620948841?casa_token=_I4VF7Tou-oAAAAA:12TbFIFvHfThB_qqJCO49Y6jxkGOEpmwhWhPUcKMLOo6xsCOOK7xxMxWzY3wMfCqBJ4nvtzxZfQd,1,1,1,,,uncertainty involved ,Decision-makers who have diminishing sensitivity to error face a smaller penalty for each marginal unit of error that a forecast produces.

ID-1139,article,The impact of text topic and assumed human vs. AI authorship on competence,"Background: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are considered positively with respect to technological progress and abilities, people are rather opposed to machines making moral decisions. But the circumstances under which algorithm aversion or algorithm appreciation are more likely to occur with respect to LLMs have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate how texts with moral or technological topics, allegedly written either by a human author or by ChatGPT, are perceived.

Methods: In a randomized controlled experiment, n = 164 participants read six texts, three of which had a moral and three a technological topic (predictor text topic). The alleged author of each text was randomly either labeled “ChatGPT” or “human author” (predictor authorship). We captured three dependent variables: assessment of author competence, assessment of content quality, and participants' intention to submit the text in a hypothetical university course (sharing intention). We hypothesized interaction effects, that is, we expected ChatGPT to score lower than alleged human authors for moral topics and higher than alleged human authors for technological topics and vice versa.

Results: We only found a small interaction effect for perceived author competence, p = 0.004, d = 0.40, but not for the other dependent variables. However, ChatGPT was consistently devalued compared to alleged human authors across all dependent variables: there were main effects of authorship for assessment of the author competence, p < 0.001, d = 0.95; for assessment of content quality, p < 0.001, d = 0.39; as well as for sharing intention, p < 0.001, d = 0.57. There was also a small main effect of text topic on the assessment of text quality, p = 0.002, d = 0.35.

Conclusion: These results are more in line with previous findings on algorithm aversion than with algorithm appreciation.

ID-1145,article,How Terminology Affects Users' Responses to System Failures,"Objective: The objective of our research is to advance the understanding of behavioral responses to a system's error. By examining trust as a dynamic variable and drawing from attribution theory, we explain the underlying mechanism and suggest how terminology can be used to mitigate the so-called algorithm aversion. In this way, we show that the use of different terms may shape consumers' perceptions and provide guidance on how these differences can be mitigated.

Background: Previous research has interchangeably used various terms to refer to a system and results regarding trust in systems have been ambiguous.

Methods: Across three studies, we examine the effect of different system terminology on consumer behavior following a system failure.

Results: Our results show that terminology crucially affects user behavior. Describing a system as ""AI"" (i.e., self-learning and perceived as more complex) instead of as ""algorithmic"" (i.e., a less complex rule-based system) leads to more favorable behavioral responses by users when a system error occurs.

Conclusion: We suggest that in cases when a system's characteristics do not allow for it to be called ""AI,"" users should be provided with an explanation of why the system's error occurred, and task complexity should be pointed out. We highlight the importance of terminology, as this can unintentionally impact the robustness and replicability of research findings.

Recent enhancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have exponentially increased user adoption. These models are accessible on mobile devices and support multimodal interactions, including conversations, code generation, and patient image uploads, broadening their utility in providing healthcare professionals with real-time support for clinical decision-making. Nevertheless, many authors have highlighted serious risks that may arise from the adoption of LLMs, principally related to safety and alignment with ethical guidelines.

Objective
To address these challenges, we introduce a novel methodological approach designed to assess the specific feasibility of adopting LLMs within a healthcare area, with a focus on clinical nursing, evaluating their performance and thereby directing their choice. Emphasizing LLMs’ adherence to scientific advancements, this approach prioritizes safety and care personalization, according to the “Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development” frameworks for responsible AI.

ID-1147,article,A survey analysis of the adoption of large language models among pathologists,"Objectives
We sought to investigate the adoption and perception of large language model (LLM) applications among pathologists.

Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted, gathering data from pathologists on their usage and views concerning LLM tools. The survey, distributed globally through various digital platforms, included quantitative and qualitative questions. Patterns in the respondents’ adoption and perspectives on these artificial intelligence tools were analyzed.

Results
Of 215 respondents, 100 (46.5%) reported using LLMs, particularly ChatGPT (OpenAI), for professional purposes, predominantly for information retrieval, proofreading, academic writing, and drafting pathology reports, highlighting a significant time-saving benefit. Academic pathologists demonstrated a better level of understanding of LLMs than their peers. Although chatbots sometimes provided incorrect general domain information, they were considered moderately proficient concerning pathology-specific knowledge. The technology was mainly used for drafting educational materials and programming tasks. The most sought-after feature in LLMs was their image analysis capabilities. Participants expressed concerns about information accuracy, privacy, and the need for regulatory approval.

Conclusions
Large language model applications are gaining notable acceptance among pathologists, with nearly half of respondents indicating adoption less than a year after the tools’ introduction to the market.

","Uncertainty permeates human social lives. Whether arising from imprecise information, ambiguous communication, or intrinsic randomness, we must make decisions about social behavior in the face of uncertain outcomes. Uncertainty and risk preferences are already understood for perfectly rational agents. But human behavior is not rational, and it typically spreads by social learning. A corresponding theory of behavioral evolution in the face of uncertainty has been lacking. Here, we extend the theory of evolutionary games to accommodate uncertainty in social interactions and variation in individual attitudes toward risk. We find that uncertainty and risk preferences can fundamentally alter the predicted behavior in a population, promoting cooperation, for example, when risk-free interactions would otherwise lead to defection.

Yet the novelty of LLMs in diagnostic decision-making introduces uncertainties regarding their impact. Clinicians unfamiliar with the use of LLMs in their professional context may rely on general attitudes towards LLMs more broadly, potentially hindering thoughtful use and critical evaluation of their input, leading to either over-reliance and lack of critical thinking or an unwillingness to use LLMs as diagnostic aids. To address these concerns, this study examines the influence on the diagnostic process and outcomes of interacting with an LLM compared with a human coach, and of prior training vs no training for interacting with either of these ‘coaches’. Our findings aim to illuminate the potential benefits and risks of employing artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnostic decision-making.
Methods and analysis We are conducting a prospective, randomised experiment with N=158 fourth-year medical students from Charité Medical School, Berlin, Germany. Participants are asked to diagnose patient vignettes after being assigned to either a human coach or ChatGPT and after either training or no training (both between-subject factors). We are specifically collecting data on the effects of using either of these ‘coaches’ and of additional training on information search, number of hypotheses entertained, diagnostic accuracy and confidence.

ID-1154,article,ChatGPT vs Medical Professional: Analyzing Responses to Laboratory Medicine Questions on Social Media,"Background
The integration of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM) developed by OpenAI, into healthcare has sparked significant interest due to its potential to enhance patient care and medical education. With the increasing trend of patients accessing laboratory results online, there is a pressing need to evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT in providing accurate laboratory medicine information. Our study evaluates ChatGPT's effectiveness in addressing patient questions in this area, comparing its performance with that of medical professionals on social media.

Methods
This study sourced patient questions and medical professional responses from Reddit and Quora, comparing them with responses generated by ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4.0. Experienced laboratory medicine professionals evaluated the responses for quality and preference. Evaluation results were further analyzed using R software.

Results
The study analyzed 49 questions, with evaluators reviewing responses from both medical professionals and ChatGPT. ChatGPT's responses were preferred by 75.9% of evaluators and generally received higher ratings for quality. They were noted for their comprehensive and accurate information, whereas responses from medical professionals were valued for their conciseness. The interrater agreement was fair, indicating some subjectivity but a consistent preference for ChatGPT's detailed responses.

Conclusions
ChatGPT demonstrates potential as an effective tool for addressing queries in laboratory medicine, often surpassing medical professionals in response quality.

We conducted weighted univariable regression and 2 weighted logistic regression models to identify predictors of expected benefit with and without accounting for trust in the health system.

Results
Comfort with the use of ChatGPT in society is relatively low and different from other, common uses of AI. Comfort was highly associated with expecting benefit. Other statistically significant factors in multivariable analysis (not including system trust) included feeling respected and low privacy concerns. Females, younger adults, and those with higher levels of education were less likely to expect benefits in models with and without system trust, which was positively associated with expecting benefits (P = 1.6 × 10−11). Tech-savviness was not associated with the outcome.

Discussion
Understanding the impact of large language models (LLMs) from the patient perspective is critical to ensuring that expectations align with performance as a form of calibrated trust that acknowledges the dynamic nature of trust.

Conclusion
Including measures of system trust in evaluating LLMs could capture a range of issues critical for ensuring patient acceptance of this technological innovation.",https://academic.oup.com/jamia/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jamia/ocae164/7705626,1,1,1,healthcare,,,,Jodyn Platt and Paige Nong and Renée Smiddy and Reema Hamasha and Gloria Carmona Clavijo and Joshua Richardson and Sharon L R Kardia,10.1093/jamia/ocae164,1527-974X,,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"artificial intelligence,large language model,patient trust,public opinion",,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocae164 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38960730,2024,England,
ID-1157,article,Artificial Intelligence in Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: Is it Ready for Prime Time?,"Purpose of Review
This review evaluates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) enhances atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment, allows for opportunistic screening, and improves adherence to guidelines through the analysis of unstructured clinical data and patient-generated data. Additionally, it discusses strategies for integrating AI into clinical practice in preventive cardiology.

Recent Findings
AI models have shown superior performance in personalized ASCVD risk evaluations compared to traditional risk scores. These models now support automated detection of ASCVD risk markers, including coronary artery calcium (CAC), across various imaging modalities such as dedicated ECG-gated CT scans, chest X-rays, mammograms, coronary angiography, and non-gated chest CT scans. Moreover, large language model (LLM) pipelines are effective in identifying and addressing gaps and disparities in ASCVD preventive care, and can also enhance patient education.

Summary
AI applications are proving invaluable in preventing and managing ASCVD and are primed for clinical use, provided they are implemented within well-regulated, iterative clinical pathways.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11883-024-01210-w,3,,,,,,,Shyon Parsa and Sulaiman Somani and Ramzi Dudum and Sneha S Jain and Fatima Rodriguez,10.1007/s11883-024-01210-w,1534-6242,7,Current atherosclerosis reports,"Artificial Intelligence,Big Data,Cardiovascular prevention,Coronary Artery Calcium,Machine Learning,health equity",,,263-272,,,26,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11883-024-01210-w https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38780665,2024,United States,

However, significant concerns have arisen over questions of liability for bad outcomes associated with LLM AI-influenced medical decision making. Although the authors were not able to identify a case in the United States that has been adjudicated on medical malpractice in the context of LLM AI at this time, sufficient precedent exists to interpret how analogous situations might be applied to these cases when they inevitably come to trial in the future. This commentary will discuss areas of potential legal vulnerability for clinicians utilizing LLM AI through review of past case law pertaining to third-party medical guidance and review the patchwork of current regulations relating to medical malpractice liability in AI. Finally, we will propose proactive policy recommendations including creating an enforcement duty at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require algorithmic transparency, recommend reliance on peer-reviewed data and rigorous validation testing when LLMs are utilized in clinical settings, and encourage tort reform to share liability between physicians and LLM developers.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jom-2023-0229 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38295300,3,,,,,,commentary,David O Shumway and Hayes J Hartman,10.1515/jom-2023-0229,2702-3648,7,Journal of osteopathic medicine,"ChatGPT,artificial intelligence,large language models,liability,medical malpractice",,,287-290,,,124,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jom-2023-0229 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38295300,2024,Germany,

ID-1160,article,"ChatGPT vs. neurologists: a cross-sectional study investigating preference, satisfaction ratings and perceived empathy in responses among people living with multiple sclerosis","Background: ChatGPT is an open-source natural language processing software that replies to users' queries. We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess people living with Multiple Sclerosis' (PwMS) preferences, satisfaction, and empathy toward two alternate responses to four frequently-asked questions, one authored by a group of neurologists, the other by ChatGPT.

Methods: An online form was sent through digital communication platforms. PwMS were blind to the author of each response and were asked to express their preference for each alternate response to the four questions. The overall satisfaction was assessed using a Likert scale (1-5); the Consultation and Relational Empathy scale was employed to assess perceived empathy.

Results: We included 1133 PwMS (age, 45.26 ± 11.50 years; females, 68.49%). ChatGPT's responses showed significantly higher empathy scores (Coeff = 1.38; 95% CI = 0.65, 2.11; p > z < 0.01), when compared with neurologists' responses. No association was found between ChatGPT' responses and mean satisfaction (Coeff = 0.03; 95% CI = - 0.01, 0.07; p = 0.157).

ID-1162,article,Future Perspective of Risk Prediction in Aesthetic Surgery: Is Artificial Intelligence Reliable?,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are showing significant potential in the medical field. The rapid advancement in artificial intelligence methods suggests their soon-to-be essential role in physicians' practices.

Objectives: This study seeks to assess and compare the readability, clarity, and precision of medical knowledge responses provided by three large language models (LLMs) and informed consent forms for 14 common aesthetic surgical procedures, as prepared by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS).

Methods: The efficacy, readability and accuracy of three leading LLMs, ChatGPT-4 (San Francisco, CA), Gemini (Google, Mountain View, California), and Copilot (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA), was systematically evaluated using 14 different prompts related to the risks of 14 common aesthetic procedures. Alongside these LLM responses, risk sections from the informed consent forms of these procedures, provided by the ASPS, were also reviewed.

Results: The risk factor segments of the combined general and specific operation consent forms were rated highest for medical knowledge accuracy. (p<0.05) Regarding readability and clarity, the procedure-specific informed consent forms, including LLMs, scored highest scores. (p<0.05) However, these same forms received the lowest score for medical knowledge accuracy. (p<0.05) Interestingly, surgeons preferred patient-facing materials created by Chat GPT-4, citing superior accuracy and medical information compared to other artificial intelligence (AI) tools.

Conclusions: Physicians prefer patient-facing materials created by Chat GPT-4 over other AI tools due to their precise and comprehensive medical knowledge.

ID-1163,article,ChatGPT’s Performance in Cardiac Arrest and Bradycardia Simulations Using the American Heart Association's Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support Guidelines: Exploratory Study,"Background:
ChatGPT is the most advanced large language model to date, with prior iterations having passed medical licensing examinations, providing clinical decision support, and improved diagnostics. Although limited, past studies of ChatGPT’s performance found that artificial intelligence could pass the American Heart Association’s advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) examinations with modifications. ChatGPT’s accuracy has not been studied in more complex clinical scenarios. As heart disease and cardiac arrest remain leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, finding technologies that help increase adherence to ACLS algorithms, which improves survival outcomes, is critical.

Objective:
This study aims to examine the accuracy of ChatGPT in following ACLS guidelines for bradycardia and cardiac arrest.

Methods:
We evaluated the accuracy of ChatGPT’s responses to 2 simulations based on the 2020 American Heart Association ACLS guidelines with 3 primary outcomes of interest: the mean individual step accuracy, the accuracy score per simulation attempt, and the accuracy score for each algorithm. For each simulation step, ChatGPT was scored for correctness (1 point) or incorrectness (0 points). Each simulation was conducted 20 times.

Results:
ChatGPT’s median accuracy for each step was 85% (IQR 40%-100%) for cardiac arrest and 30% (IQR 13%-81%) for bradycardia. ChatGPT’s median accuracy over 20 simulation attempts for cardiac arrest was 69% (IQR 67%-74%) and for bradycardia was 42% (IQR 33%-50%). We found that ChatGPT’s outputs varied despite consistent input, the same actions were persistently missed, repetitive overemphasis hindered guidance, and erroneous medication information was presented.

ID-1165,article,"Can ChatGPT assist authors with abstract writing in medical journals? Evaluating the quality of scientific abstracts generated by ChatGPT and original abstracts
","Introduction: ChatGPT, a sophisticated large language model (LLM), has garnered widespread attention for its ability to mimic human-like communication. As recent studies indicate a potential supportive role of ChatGPT in academic writing, we assessed the LLM's capacity to generate accurate and comprehensive scientific abstracts from published Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) data, focusing on the adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for Abstracts (CONSORT-A) statement, in comparison to the original authors' abstracts.

Methodology: RCTs, identified in a PubMed/MEDLINE search post-September 2021 across various medical disciplines, were subjected to abstract generation via ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4, following the guidelines of the respective journals. The overall quality score (OQS) of each abstract was determined by the total number of adequately reported components from the 18-item CONSORT-A checklist. Additional outcome measures included percent adherence to each CONOSORT-A item, readability, hallucination rate, and regression analysis of reporting quality determinants.

Results: Original abstracts achieved a mean OQS of 11.89 (95% CI: 11.23-12.54), outperforming GPT 3.5 (7.89; 95% CI: 7.32-8.46) and GPT 4 (5.18; 95% CI: 4.64-5.71). Compared to GPT 3.5 and 4 outputs, original abstracts were more adherent with 10 and 14 CONSORT-A items, respectively. In blind assessments, GPT 3.5-generated abstracts were deemed most readable in 62.22% of cases which was significantly greater than the original (31.11%; P = 0.003) and GPT 4-generated (6.67%; P<0.001) abstracts. Moreover, ChatGPT 3.5 exhibited a hallucination rate of 0.03 items per abstract compared to 1.13 by GPT 4. No determinants for improved reporting quality were identified for GPT-generated abstracts.

","Objectives: We aimed to examine the adherence of large language models (LLMs) to bacterial meningitis guidelines using a hypothetical medical case, highlighting their utility and limitations in healthcare.

Methods: A simulated clinical scenario of a patient with bacterial meningitis secondary to mastoiditis was presented in three independent sessions to seven publicly accessible LLMs (Bard, Bing, Claude-2, GTP-3.5, GTP-4, Llama, PaLM). Responses were evaluated for adherence to good clinical practice and two international meningitis guidelines.

Results: A central nervous system infection was identified in 90% of LLM sessions. All recommended imaging, while 81% suggested lumbar puncture. Blood cultures and specific mastoiditis work-up were proposed in only 62% and 38% sessions, respectively. Only 38% of sessions provided the correct empirical antibiotic treatment, while antiviral treatment and dexamethasone were advised in 33% and 24%, respectively. Misleading statements were generated in 52%. No significant correlation was found between LLMs' text length and performance (r=0.29, p=0.20). Among all LLMs, GTP-4 demonstrated the best performance.

Discussion: Latest LLMs provide valuable advice on differential diagnosis and diagnostic procedures but significantly vary in treatment-specific information for bacterial meningitis when introduced to a realistic clinical scenario. Misleading statements were common, with performance differences attributed to each LLM's unique algorithm rather than output length.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical potential of state-of-the-art LLMs in ophthalmology using a more robust benchmark than raw examination scores. We trialled GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on 347 ophthalmology questions before GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM 2, LLaMA, expert ophthalmologists, and doctors in training were trialled on a mock examination of 87 questions. Performance was analysed with respect to question subject and type (first order recall and higher order reasoning). Masked ophthalmologists graded the accuracy, relevance, and overall preference of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 responses to the same questions. The performance of GPT-4 (69%) was superior to GPT-3.5 (48%), LLaMA (32%), and PaLM 2 (56%). GPT-4 compared favourably with expert ophthalmologists (median 76%, range 64-90%), ophthalmology trainees (median 59%, range 57-63%), and unspecialised junior doctors (median 43%, range 41-44%). Low agreement between LLMs and doctors reflected idiosyncratic differences in knowledge and reasoning with overall consistency across subjects and types (p>0.05). All ophthalmologists preferred GPT-4 responses over GPT-3.5 and rated the accuracy and relevance of GPT-4 as higher (p<0.05).

ID-1171,article,"Awareness and Use of ChatGPT and Large Language Models: A Prospective Cross-sectional Global Survey in Urology
","Background
Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has captivated society and shown potential for various aspects of health care.

Objective
To investigate potential use of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), in urology by gathering opinions from urologists worldwide.

Design, setting, and participants
An open web-based survey was distributed via social media and e-mail chains to urologists between April 20, 2023 and May 5, 2023. Participants were asked to answer questions related to their knowledge and experience with artificial intelligence, as well as their opinions of potential use of ChatGPT/LLMs in research and clinical practice.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis
Data are reported as the mean and standard deviation for continuous variables, and the frequency and percentage for categorical variables. Charts and tables are used as appropriate, with descriptions of the chart types and the measures used. The data are reported in accordance with the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES).

Results and limitations
A total of 456 individuals completed the survey (64% completion rate). Nearly half (47.7%) reported that they use ChatGPT/LLMs in their academic practice, with fewer using the technology in clinical practice (19.8%). More than half (62.2%) believe there are potential ethical concerns when using ChatGPT for scientific or academic writing, and 53% reported that they have experienced limitations when using ChatGPT in academic practice.

Conclusions
Urologists recognise the potential of ChatGPT/LLMs in research but have concerns regarding ethics and patient acceptance. There is a desire for regulations and guidelines to ensure appropriate use. In addition, measures should be taken to establish rules and guidelines to maximise safety and efficiency when using this novel technology.

ID-1172,article,"Assessing the Alignment of Large Language Models With Human Values for Mental Health Integration: Cross-Sectional Study Using Schwartz’s Theory of Basic Values
","Background
Large language models (LLMs) hold potential for mental health applications. However, their opaque alignment processes may embed biases that shape problematic perspectives. Evaluating the values embedded within LLMs that guide their decision-making have ethical importance. Schwartz’s theory of basic values (STBV) provides a framework for quantifying cultural value orientations and has shown utility for examining values in mental health contexts, including cultural, diagnostic, and therapist-client dynamics.

Objective
This study aimed to (1) evaluate whether the STBV can measure value-like constructs within leading LLMs and (2) determine whether LLMs exhibit distinct value-like patterns from humans and each other.

Methods
In total, 4 LLMs (Bard, Claude 2, Generative Pretrained Transformer [GPT]-3.5, GPT-4) were anthropomorphized and instructed to complete the Portrait Values Questionnaire—Revised (PVQ-RR) to assess value-like constructs. Their responses over 10 trials were analyzed for reliability and validity. To benchmark the LLMs’ value profiles, their results were compared to published data from a diverse sample of 53,472 individuals across 49 nations who had completed the PVQ-RR. This allowed us to assess whether the LLMs diverged from established human value patterns across cultural groups. Value profiles were also compared between models via statistical tests.

Results
The PVQ-RR showed good reliability and validity for quantifying value-like infrastructure within the LLMs. However, substantial divergence emerged between the LLMs’ value profiles and population data. The models lacked consensus and exhibited distinct motivational biases, reflecting opaque alignment processes. For example, all models prioritized universalism and self-direction, while de-emphasizing achievement, power, and security relative to humans. Successful discriminant analysis differentiated the 4 LLMs’ distinct value profiles. Further examination found the biased value profiles strongly predicted the LLMs’ responses when presented with mental health dilemmas requiring choosing between opposing values. This provided further validation for the models embedding distinct motivational value-like constructs that shape their decision-making.

Conclusions
This study leveraged the STBV to map the motivational value-like infrastructure underpinning leading LLMs. Although the study demonstrated the STBV can effectively characterize value-like infrastructure within LLMs, substantial divergence from human values raises ethical concerns about aligning these models with mental health applications. The biases toward certain cultural value sets pose risks if integrated without proper safeguards. For example, prioritizing universalism could promote unconditional acceptance even when clinically unwise. Furthermore, the differences between the LLMs underscore the need to standardize alignment processes to capture true cultural diversity. Thus, any responsible integration of LLMs into mental health care must account for their embedded biases and motivation mismatches to ensure equitable delivery across diverse populations. Achieving this will require transparency and refinement of alignment techniques to instill comprehensive human values.",http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/55988 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38593424 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11040439,3,,,,,,,Dorit Hadar-Shoval and Kfir Asraf and Yonathan Mizrachi and Yuval Haber and Zohar Elyoseph,10.2196/55988,2368-7959,,JMIR mental health,"AI,Bard,Chat-GPT,ChatGPT,Claude,LLM,LLMs,ML,NLP,algorithm,algorithms,artificial intelligence,chat-bot,chat-bots,chatbot,chatbots,deep learning,eHealth,large language model,large language models,mHealth,machine learning,mental disease,mental diseases,mental disorder,mental disorders,mental health,mental illness,mental illnesses,mobile health,mood disorder,mood disorders,natural language processing,practical model,practical models,predictive analytics,predictive model,predictive models,predictive system,values",,,e55988,,,11,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/55988 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38593424 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11040439,2024,Canada,
ID-1173,article,"Comprehensiveness, Accuracy, and Readability of Exercise Recommendations Provided by an AI-Based Chatbot: Mixed Methods Study
","Background: Regular physical activity is critical for health and disease prevention. Yet, health care providers and patients face barriers to implement evidence-based lifestyle recommendations. The potential to augment care with the increased availability of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is limitless; however, the suitability of AI-generated exercise recommendations has yet to be explored.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and readability of individualized exercise recommendations generated by a novel AI chatbot.

Methods: A coding scheme was developed to score AI-generated exercise recommendations across ten categories informed by gold-standard exercise recommendations, including (1) health condition-specific benefits of exercise, (2) exercise preparticipation health screening, (3) frequency, (4) intensity, (5) time, (6) type, (7) volume, (8) progression, (9) special considerations, and (10) references to the primary literature. The AI chatbot was prompted to provide individualized exercise recommendations for 26 clinical populations using an open-source application programming interface. Two independent reviewers coded AI-generated content for each category and calculated comprehensiveness (%) and factual accuracy (%) on a scale of 0%-100%. Readability was assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid formula. Qualitative analysis identified and categorized themes from AI-generated output.

Results: AI-generated exercise recommendations were 41.2% (107/260) comprehensive and 90.7% (146/161) accurate, with the majority (8/15, 53%) of inaccuracy related to the need for exercise preparticipation medical clearance. Average readability level of AI-generated exercise recommendations was at the college level (mean 13.7, SD 1.7), with an average Flesch reading ease score of 31.1 (SD 7.7). Several recurring themes and observations of AI-generated output included concern for liability and safety, preference for aerobic exercise, and potential bias and direct discrimination against certain age-based populations and individuals with disabilities.

Conclusions: There were notable gaps in the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and readability of AI-generated exercise recommendations.

ID-1179,article,"Do Large Language Models Show Decision Heuristics Similar to Humans?
A Case Study Using GPT-3.5","A Large Language Model (LLM) is an artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of natural language data, enabling it to generate human-like responses to written or spoken language input. Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5 is an example of an LLM that supports a conversational agent called ChatGPT. In this
work, we used a series of novel prompts to determine whether ChatGPT shows heuristics and other contextsensitive responses. We also tested the same prompts on human participants. Across four studies, we found that ChatGPT was influenced by random anchors in making estimates (anchoring, Study 1); it judged the likelihood of two events occurring together to be higher than the likelihood of either event occurring alone, and it was influenced by anecdotal information (representativeness and availability heuristic, Study 2); it found an item to be more efficacious when its features were presented positively rather than negatively even though both presentations contained statistically equivalent information (framing effect, Study 3); and it valued an owned item more than a newly found item even though the two items were objectively identical (endowment effect, Study 4). In each study, human participants showed similar effects. Heuristics and context-sensitive responses in humans are thought to be driven by cognitive and affective processes such as loss aversion and effort reduction. The fact that an LLM—which lacks these processes—also shows such responses invites consideration of the possibility that language is sufficiently rich to carry these effects and may play a role in generating these effects in humans.",https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2024-50870-001.pdf,3,,,,,,comparing AI to human decision-making processes,Gaurav Suri and Lily R Slater and Ali Ziaee and Morgan Nguyen,10.1037/xge0001547,1939-2222,4,Journal of experimental psychology.

LLMs can generate educational material, summarize text, extract structured data from free text, create reports, write programs, and potentially assist in case sign-out. LLMs combined with vision models can assist in interpreting histopathology images. LLMs have immense potential in transforming pathology practice and education, but these models are not infallible, so any artificial intelligence generated content must be verified with reputable sources. Caution must be exercised on how these models are integrated into clinical practice, as these models can produce hallucinations and incorrect results, and an over-reliance on artificial intelligence may lead to de-skilling and automation bias.

","Background: ChatGPT is a well-known large language model-based chatbot. It could be used in the medical field in many aspects. However, some physicians are still unfamiliar with ChatGPT and are concerned about its benefits and risks.

Objective: We aim to evaluate the perception of physicians and medical students toward using ChatGPT in the medical field.

Methods: A web-based questionnaire was sent to medical students, interns, residents, and attending staff with questions regarding their perception toward using ChatGPT in clinical practice and medical education. Participants were also asked to rate their perception of ChatGPT's generated response about knee osteoarthritis.

Results: Participants included 124 medical students, 46 interns, 37 residents, and 32 attending staff. After reading ChatGPT's response, 132 of the 239 (55.2%) participants had a positive rating about using ChatGPT for clinical practice. The proportion of positive answers was significantly lower in graduated physicians (48/115, 42%) compared with medical students (84/124, 68%; P<.001). Participants listed a lack of a patient-specific treatment plan, updated evidence, and a language barrier as ChatGPT's pitfalls. Regarding using ChatGPT for medical education, the proportion of positive responses was also significantly lower in graduate physicians (71/115, 62%) compared to medical students (103/124, 83.1%; P<.001). Participants were concerned that ChatGPT's response was too superficial, might lack scientific evidence, and might need expert verification.

Conclusions: Medical students generally had a positive perception of using ChatGPT for guiding treatment and medical education, whereas graduated doctors were more cautious in this regard.

In manufacturing, operating production lines has become increasingly knowledge-intensive, putting strain on a factory's capacity to train and support new operators. This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system designed to retrieve information from the extensive knowledge contained in factory documentation and knowledge shared by expert operators. The system aims to efficiently answer queries from operators and facilitate the sharing of new knowledge. We conducted a user study at a factory to assess its potential impact and adoption, eliciting several perceived benefits, namely, enabling quicker information retrieval and more efficient resolution of issues. However, the study also highlighted a preference for learning from a human expert when such an option is available.

ID-1188,article,"A Narrative Review of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Objective Assessment of Aesthetic Endpoints in Plastic Surgery
","Notoriously characterized by subjectivity and lack of solid scientific validation, reporting aesthetic outcome in plastic surgery is usually based on ill-defined end points and subjective measures very often from the patients' and/or providers' perspective. With the tremendous increase in demand for all types of aesthetic procedures, there is an urgent need for better understanding of aesthetics and beauty in addition to reliable and objective outcome measures to quantitate what is perceived as beautiful and attractive. In an era of evidence-based medicine, recognition of the importance of science with evidence-based approach to aesthetic surgery is long overdue. View the many limitations of conventional outcome evaluation tools of aesthetic interventions, objective outcome analysis provided by tools described to be reliable is being investigated such as advanced artificial intelligence (AI). The current review is intended to analyze available evidence regarding advantages as well as limitations of this technology in objectively documenting outcome of aesthetic interventions. It has shown that some AI applications such as facial emotions recognition systems are capable of objectively measuring and quantitating patients' reported outcomes and defining aesthetic interventions success from the patients' perspective. Though not reported yet, observers' satisfaction with the results and their appreciation of aesthetic attributes may also be measured in the same manner.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00266-023-03328-9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37000298,3,,,,,,,Bishara Atiyeh and Saif Emsieh and Christopher Hakim and Rawad Chalhoub,10.1007/s00266-023-03328-9,1432-5241,6,Aesthetic plastic surgery,"Aesthetics,Artificial intelligence,Objective assessment",,,2862-2873,,,47,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00266-023-03328-9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37000298,2023,United States,

","Emotions, long deemed a distinctly human characteristic, guide a repertoire of behaviors, e.g., promoting risk-aversion under negative emotional states or generosity under positive ones. The question of whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can possess emotions remains elusive, chiefly due to the absence of an operationalized consensus on what constitutes 'emotion' within AI. Adopting a pragmatic approach, this study investigated the response patterns of AI chatbots—specifically, large language models (LLMs)—to various emotional primes. We engaged AI chatbots as one would human participants, presenting scenarios designed to elicit positive, negative, or neutral emotional states. Multiple accounts of OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus were then tasked with responding to inquiries concerning investment decisions and prosocial behaviors. Our analysis revealed that ChatGPT-4 bots, when primed with positive, negative, or neutral emotions, exhibited distinct response patterns in both risk-taking and prosocial decisions, a phenomenon less evident in the ChatGPT-3.5 iterations. This observation suggests an enhanced capacity for modulating responses based on emotional cues in more advanced LLMs. While these findings do not suggest the presence of emotions in AI, they underline the feasibility of swaying AI responses by leveraging emotional indicators.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55949-y https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38528008 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10963757,3,,,,,,"Do AI chatbots exhibit ""emotions"" similar to humans? engaged with chatbots as if they were human participants",Yukun Zhao and Zhen Huang and Martin Seligman and Kaiping Peng,10.1038/s41598-024-55949-y,2045-2322,1,Scientific reports,,,,7095,,,14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55949-y https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38528008 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10963757,2024,England,
ID-1191,article,"Modeling the influence of attitudes, trust, and beliefs on endoscopists’ acceptance of artificial intelligence applications in medical practice","Introduction: The potential for deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in various fields of medicine is vast, yet acceptance of AI amongst clinicians has been patchy. This research therefore examines the role of antecedents, namely trust, attitude, and beliefs in driving AI acceptance in clinical practice.

Methods: We utilized online surveys to gather data from clinicians in the field of gastroenterology.

Results: A total of 164 participants responded to the survey. Participants had a mean age of 44.49 (SD = 9.65). Most participants were male (n = 116, 70.30%) and specialized in gastroenterology (n = 153, 92.73%). Based on the results collected, we proposed and tested a model of AI acceptance in medical practice. Our findings showed that while the proposed drivers had a positive impact on AI tools’ acceptance, not all effects were direct. Trust and belief were found to fully mediate the effects of attitude on AI acceptance by clinicians.

Discussion: The role of trust and beliefs as primary mediators of the acceptance of AI in medical practice suggest that these should be areas of focus in AI education, engagement and training. This has implications for how AI systems can gain greater clinician acceptance to engender greater trust and adoption amongst public health systems and professional networks which in turn would impact how populations interface with AI.

ID-1193,article,Competitive organizational climate and artificial intelligence (AI) acceptance: the moderating role of leaders’ power construal,"Introduction: The incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in organizations is pivotal to deal with work-related tasks and challenges effectively, yet little is known about the organizational factors that influence AI acceptance (i.e., employee favorable AI attitudes and AI use). To address this limitation in the literature and provide insight into the organizational antecedents influencing AI acceptance, this research investigated the relationship between competitive organizational climate and AI acceptance among employees. Moreover, given the critical role of a leader in employee attitude and behavior, we examined the moderating role of leaders’ power construal as responsibility or as opportunity in this relationship.

Methods: Study 1 was a three-wave field study among employees (N = 237, Mage = 38.28) working in various organizations in the UK. The study measured employees’ perception of a competitive organizational climate at Time 1, leaders’ power construal (as perceived by employees) at Time 2, and employee attitudes towards AI and their actual use of AI in the workplace at Times 2 and 3. Study 2 was a 2 (climate: highly competitive vs. low competitive) by 2 (power construal: responsibility vs. opportunity) experiment among employee participants (N = 150, Mage = 37.50).

Results: Study 1 demonstrated a positive relationship between competitive climate and employee AI use over time. Furthermore, both studies revealed an interaction between competitive climate and leader’s power construal in the prediction of employee AI acceptance: In Study 1, competitive climate was negatively related to AI acceptance over time when leaders construed power as opportunity. In Study 2 competitive climate was positively related to AI acceptance when leaders construed power as responsibility rather than as opportunity.

Discussion: These results underscore the organizational factors that are required in order for employees to shape favorable attitudes towards AI and actually use AI at work.

","Background
The emergence of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), may manifest as technology panic in some people, including adolescents who may be particularly vulnerable to new technologies (the use of AI can lead to AI dependence, which can threaten mental health). While the relationship between AI dependence and mental health is a growing topic, the few existing studies are mainly cross-sectional and use qualitative approaches, failing to find a longitudinal relationship between them. Based on the framework of technology dependence, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of experiencing AI dependence, to examine the cross-lagged effects between mental health problems (anxiety/depression) and AI dependence and to explore the mediating role of AI use motivations.

Methods
A two-wave cohort program with 3843 adolescents (Male = 1848, Mage = 13.21 ± 2.55) was used with a cross-lagged panel model and a half-longitudinal mediation model.

Results
17.14% of the adolescents experienced AI dependence at T1, and 24.19% experienced dependence at T2. Only mental health problems positively predicted subsequent AI dependence, not vice versa. For AI use motivation, escape motivation and social motivation mediated the relationship between mental health problems and AI dependence whereas entertainment motivation and instrumental motivation did not.

Discussion
Excessive panic about AI dependence is currently unnecessary, and AI has promising applications in alleviating emotional problems in adolescents. Innovation in AI is rapid, and more research is needed to confirm and evaluate the impact of AI use on adolescents’ mental health and the implications and future directions are discussed.",http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S440889 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38495087 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10944174,3,,,,,,,Shunsen Huang and Xiaoxiong Lai and Li Ke and Yajun Li and Huanlei Wang and Xinmei Zhao and Xinran Dai and Yun Wang,10.2147/PRBM.S440889,1179-1578,,Psychology research and behavior management,"adolescents,anxiety,artificial intelligence dependence,artificial intelligence use motivation,depression,mental health",,,1087-1102,,,17,http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S440889 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38495087 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10944174,2024,New Zealand,

","Objective: The objective of the current study was to assess the quality of large language model (LLM) chatbot versus physician-generated responses to patient-generated rheumatology questions.

Methods: We conducted a single-center cross-sectional survey of rheumatology patients (n = 17) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Patients evaluated LLM chatbot versus physician-generated responses for comprehensiveness and readability, with four rheumatologists also evaluating accuracy by using a Likert scale from 1 to 10 (1 being poor, 10 being excellent).

Results: Patients rated no significant difference between artificial intelligence (AI) and physician-generated responses in comprehensiveness (mean 7.12 ± SD 0.99 vs 7.52 ± 1.16; P = 0.1962) or readability (7.90 ± 0.90 vs 7.80 ± 0.75; P = 0.5905). Rheumatologists rated AI responses significantly poorer than physician responses on comprehensiveness (AI 5.52 ± 2.13 vs physician 8.76 ± 1.07; P < 0.0001), readability (AI 7.85 ± 0.92 vs physician 8.75 ± 0.57; P = 0.0003), and accuracy (AI 6.48 ± 2.07 vs physician 9.08 ± 0.64; P < 0.0001). The proportion of preference to AI- versus physician-generated responses by patients and physicians was 0.45 ± 0.18 and 0.15 ± 0.08, respectively (P = 0.0106). After learning that one answer for each question was AI generated, patients were able to correctly identify AI-generated answers at a lower proportion compared to physicians (0.49 ± 0.26 vs 0.97 ± 0.04; P = 0.0183). The average word count of AI answers was 69.10 ± 25.35 words, as compared to 98.83 ± 34.58 words for physician-generated responses (P = 0.0008).

Conclusion: Rheumatology patients rated AI-generated responses to patient questions similarly to physician-generated responses in terms of comprehensiveness, readability, and overall preference.

","The increasing access to health data worldwide is driving a resurgence in machine learning research, including data-hungry deep learning algorithms. More computationally efficient algorithms now offer unique opportunities to enhance diagnosis, risk stratification, and individualised approaches to patient management. Such opportunities are particularly relevant for the management of older patients, a group that is characterised by complex multimorbidity patterns and significant interindividual variability in homeostatic capacity, organ function, and response to treatment. Clinical tools that utilise machine learning algorithms to determine the optimal choice of treatment are slowly gaining the necessary approval from governing bodies and being implemented into healthcare, with significant implications for virtually all medical disciplines during the next phase of digital medicine. Beyond obtaining regulatory approval, a crucial element in implementing these tools is the trust and support of the people that use them. In this context, an increased understanding by clinicians of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms provides an appreciation of the possible benefits, risks, and uncertainties, and improves the chances for successful adoption. This review provides a broad taxonomy of machine learning algorithms, followed by a more detailed description of each algorithm class, their purpose and capabilities, and examples of their applications, particularly in geriatric medicine. Additional focus is given on the clinical implications and challenges involved in relying on devices with reduced interpretability and the progress made in counteracting the latter via the development of explainable machine learning.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40520-023-02552-2,3,,,,,,"a lot of articles in the medical domain discuss ""decision support systems.""

ID-1206,article,The impact of human-AI collaboration types on consumer evaluation and usage intention: a perspective of responsibility attribution,"Despite the widespread availability of artificial intelligence (AI) products and services, consumer evaluations and adoption intentions have not met expectations. Existing research mainly focuses on AI’s instrumental attributes from the consumer perspective, along with negative impacts of AI failures on evaluations and willingness to use. However, research is lacking on AI as a collaborative agent, investigating the impact of human-AI collaboration on AI acceptance under different outcome expectations. This study examines the interactive effects of human-AI collaboration types (AI-dominant vs. AI-assisted) and outcome expectations (positive vs. negative) on AI product evaluations and usage willingness, along with the underlying mechanisms, from a human-AI relationship perspective. It also investigates the moderating role of algorithm transparency in these effects. Using three online experiments with analysis of variance and bootstrap methods, the study validates these interactive mechanisms, revealing the mediating role of attribution and moderating role of algorithm transparency. Experiment 1 confirms the interactive effects of human-AI collaboration types and outcome expectations on consumer evaluations and usage willingness. Under positive outcome expectations, consumers evaluate and express willingness to use AI-dominant intelligent vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities higher than those with emergency evasion capabilities (AI-assisted). However, under negative outcome expectations, consumers rate autonomous driving capabilities lower compared to emergency evasion capabilities. Experiment 2 examines the mediating role of attribution through ChatGPT’s dominant or assisting role under different outcome expectations. Experiment 3 uses a clinical decision-making system to study algorithm transparency’s moderating role, showing higher transparency improves evaluations and willingness to use AI products and services under negative outcome expectations. Theoretically, this study advances consumer behavior research by exploring the human-AI relationship within artificial intelligence, enhancing understanding of consumer acceptance variations. Practically, it offers insights for better integrating AI products and services into the market.

ID-1209,article,"Health Care Trainees' and Professionals' Perceptions of ChatGPT in Improving Medical Knowledge Training: Rapid Survey Study
","Background: ChatGPT is a powerful pretrained large language model. It has both demonstrated potential and raised concerns related to knowledge translation and knowledge transfer. To apply and improve knowledge transfer in the real world, it is essential to assess the perceptions and acceptance of the users of ChatGPT-assisted training.

Objective: We aimed to investigate the perceptions of health care trainees and professionals on ChatGPT-assisted training, using biomedical informatics as an example.

Methods: We used purposeful sampling to include all health care undergraduate trainees and graduate professionals (n=195) from January to May 2023 in the School of Public Health at the National Defense Medical Center in Taiwan. Subjects were asked to watch a 2-minute video introducing 5 scenarios about ChatGPT-assisted training in biomedical informatics and then answer a self-designed online (web- and mobile-based) questionnaire according to the Kirkpatrick model. The survey responses were used to develop 4 constructs: ""perceived knowledge acquisition,"" ""perceived training motivation,"" ""perceived training satisfaction,"" and ""perceived training effectiveness."" The study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate and test the structural model and hypotheses.

Results: The online questionnaire response rate was 152 of 195 (78%); 88 of 152 participants (58%) were undergraduate trainees and 90 of 152 participants (59%) were women. The ages ranged from 18 to 53 years (mean 23.3, SD 6.0 years). There was no statistical difference in perceptions of training evaluation between men and women. Most participants were enthusiastic about the ChatGPT-assisted training, while the graduate professionals were more enthusiastic than undergraduate trainees. Nevertheless, some concerns were raised about potential cheating on training assessment. The average scores for knowledge acquisition, training motivation, training satisfaction, and training effectiveness were 3.84 (SD 0.80), 3.76 (SD 0.93), 3.75 (SD 0.87), and 3.72 (SD 0.91), respectively (Likert scale 1-5: strongly disagree to strongly agree). Knowledge acquisition had the highest score and training effectiveness the lowest. In the SEM results, training effectiveness was influenced predominantly by knowledge acquisition and partially met the hypotheses in the research framework. Knowledge acquisition had a direct effect on training effectiveness, training satisfaction, and training motivation, with β coefficients of .80, .87, and .97, respectively (all P<.001).

Conclusions: Most health care trainees and professionals perceived ChatGPT-assisted training as an aid in knowledge transfer. However, to improve training effectiveness, it should be combined with empirical experts for proper guidance and dual interaction. In a future study, we recommend using a larger sample size for evaluation of internet-connected large language models in medical knowledge transfer.",https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e49385,3,,,,,,,Je-Ming Hu and Feng-Cheng Liu and Chi-Ming Chu and Yu-Tien Chang,10.2196/49385,1438-8871,,Journal of medical Internet research,"ChatGPT,SEM,internet survey,large language model,medicine,perception evaluation,structural equation modeling",,,e49385,,,25,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/49385 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37851495 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10620632,2023,Canada,

ID-1232,article,"An integrative review on the acceptance of artificial intelligence among healthcare professionals in hospitals
","Artificial intelligence (AI) in the domain of healthcare is increasing in prominence. Acceptance is an indispensable prerequisite for the widespread implementation of AI. The aim of this integrative review is to explore barriers and facilitators influencing healthcare professionals’ acceptance of AI in the hospital setting. Forty-two articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Pertinent elements to the study such as the type of AI, factors influencing acceptance, and the participants’ profession were extracted from the included studies, and the studies were appraised for their quality. The data extraction and results were presented according to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The included studies revealed a variety of facilitating and hindering factors for AI acceptance in the hospital setting. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) were the AI form included in most studies (n = 21). Heterogeneous results with regard to the perceptions of the effects of AI on error occurrence, alert sensitivity and timely resources were reported. In contrast, fear of a loss of (professional) autonomy and difficulties in integrating AI into clinical workflows were unanimously reported to be hindering factors. On the other hand, training for the use of AI facilitated acceptance. Heterogeneous results may be explained by differences in the application and functioning of the different AI systems as well as inter-professional and interdisciplinary disparities. To conclude, in order to facilitate acceptance of AI among healthcare professionals it is advisable to integrate end-users in the early stages of AI development as well as to offer needs-adjusted training for the use of AI in healthcare and providing adequate infrastructure.

ID-1246,article,Ethical and legal considerations influencing human involvement in the implementation of artificial intelligence in a clinical pathway: A multi-stakeholder perspective,"Introduction: Ethical and legal factors will have an important bearing on when and whether automation is appropriate in healthcare. There is a developing literature on the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in health, including specific legal or regulatory questions such as whether there is a right to an explanation of AI decision-making. However, there has been limited consideration of the specific ethical and legal factors that influence when, and in what form, human involvement may be required in the implementation of AI in a clinical pathway, and the views of the wide range of stakeholders involved. To address this question, we chose the exemplar of the pathway for the early detection of Barrett's Oesophagus (BE) and oesophageal adenocarcinoma, where Gehrung and colleagues have developed a “semi-automated”, deep-learning system to analyse samples from the CytospongeTM TFF3 test (a minimally invasive alternative to endoscopy), where AI promises to mitigate increasing demands for pathologists' time and input.

Methods: We gathered a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders, including developers, patients, healthcare professionals and regulators, to obtain their perspectives on the ethical and legal issues that may arise using this exemplar.

Results: The findings are grouped under six general themes: risk and potential harms; impacts on human experts; equity and bias; transparency and oversight; patient information and choice; accountability, moral responsibility and liability for error. Within these themes, a range of subtle and context-specific elements emerged, highlighting the importance of pre-implementation, interdisciplinary discussions and appreciation of pathway specific considerations.

Discussion: To evaluate these findings, we draw on the well-established principles of biomedical ethics identified by Beauchamp and Childress as a lens through which to view these results and their implications for personalised medicine. Our findings are not only relevant to this context but have implications for AI in digital pathology and healthcare more broadly.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10043985,1,2,2,healthcare,,,,Elizabeth Redrup Hill and Colin Mitchell and Tanya Brigden and Alison Hall,10.3389/fdgth.2023.1139210,2673-253X,,Frontiers in digital health,"artificial intelligence,digital pathology,healthcare,human involvement,interdisciplinary,law,medical ethics",,,1139210,,,5,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2023.1139210 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36999168 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10043985,2023,,

ID-1251,article,Assessing the value of ChatGPT for clinical decision support optimization,"Objective: To determine if ChatGPT can generate useful suggestions for improving clinical decision support (CDS) logic and to assess noninferiority compared to human-generated suggestions.

Methods: We supplied summaries of CDS logic to ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) tool for question answering that uses a large language model, and asked it to generate suggestions. We asked human clinician reviewers to review the AI-generated suggestions as well as human-generated suggestions for improving the same CDS alerts, and rate the suggestions for their usefulness, acceptance, relevance, understanding, workflow, bias, inversion, and redundancy.

Results: Five clinicians analyzed 36 AI-generated suggestions and 29 human-generated suggestions for 7 alerts. Of the 20 suggestions that scored highest in the survey, 9 were generated by ChatGPT. The suggestions generated by AI were found to offer unique perspectives and were evaluated as highly understandable and relevant, with moderate usefulness, low acceptance, bias, inversion, redundancy.

Conclusion: AI-generated suggestions could be an important complementary part of optimizing CDS alerts, can identify potential improvements to alert logic and support their implementation, and may even be able to assist experts in formulating their own suggestions for CDS improvement. ChatGPT shows great potential for using large language models and reinforcement learning from human feedback to improve CDS alert logic and potentially other medical areas involving complex, clinical logic, a key step in the development of an advanced learning health system.

ID-1252,article,Adoption of AI in response to COVID-19-a configurational perspective,"Although the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) has often been highlighted in strategic agility and decision outcomes, whether it helps firms strengthen their competitiveness and the means firms use to achieve such competitiveness are still under-researched. Our research thus joins the recent discussion on digitalization trends and strategic responses to COVID-19 to better understand how firms strengthen their competitiveness during such challenging times. Namely, this study incorporates the strategic responses to COVID-19 into the technology–organization–environment (TOE) framework by investigating the impacts of different configurations of TOE contexts and strategic responses on a firm’s competitive advantage. We used fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to investigate how TOE contexts and strategic responses integrate into configurations and impact a firm’s competiveness. By applying a configurational approach with data from 514 exporting firms in China, we find a strong indication of the equifinality of different strategies, indicating that multiple strategic paths can be used to respond to crises. The adoption of AI, while important, is not sufficient to enhance a firm’s competitiveness. Our results stress the significance of data quality, organizational resources and capabilities, and digital business model innovation for AI adoption. We also identify successful strategic paths of AI adoption aversion and ambidextrous strategies. The findings have practical implications for firms seeking effective strategies to respond to future crises and sustain their competitive advantages.

ID-1254,article,"Artificial intelligence (AI) acceptance in primary care during the coronavirus pandemic: What is the role of patients' gender, age and health awareness? A two-phase pilot study
","Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is steadily entering and transforming the health care and Primary Care (PC) domains. AI-based applications assist physicians in disease detection, medical advice, triage, clinical decision-making, diagnostics and digital public health. Recent literature has explored physicians' perspectives on the potential impact of digital public health on key tasks in PC. However, limited attention has been given to patients' perspectives of AI acceptance in PC, specifically during the coronavirus pandemic. Addressing this research gap, we administered a pilot study to investigate criteria for patients' readiness to use AI-based PC applications by analyzing key factors affecting the adoption of digital public health technology.

Methods: The pilot study utilized a two-phase mixed methods approach. First, we conducted a qualitative study with 18 semi-structured interviews. Second, based on the Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM), we conducted an online survey (n = 447).

Results: The results indicate that respondents who scored high on innovativeness had a higher level of readiness to use AI-based technology in PC during the coronavirus pandemic. Surprisingly, patients' health awareness and sociodemographic factors, such as age, gender and education, were not significant predictors of AI-based technology acceptance in PC.

Conclusions: This paper makes two major contributions. First, we highlight key social and behavioral determinants of acceptance of AI-enabled health care and PC applications. Second, we propose that to increase the usability of digital public health tools and accelerate patients' AI adoption, in complex digital public health care ecosystems, we call for implementing adaptive, population-specific promotions of AI technologies and applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9868720,1,"1, 2",1,"medical, healthcare",,,,Hila Chalutz Ben-Gal,10.3389/fpubh.2022.931225,2296-2565,,Frontiers in public health,"artificial intelligence,coronavirus pandemic,digital public health,health awareness,pilot study,primary care",,,931225,,,10,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.931225 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36699881 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9868720,2022,,
ID-1255,article,"Algorithms in the court: does it matter which part of the judicial decision-making is automated?
","Artificial intelligence plays an increasingly important role in legal disputes, influencing not only the reality outside the court but also the judicial decision-making process itself. While it is clear why judges may generally benefit from technology as a tool for reducing effort costs or increasing accuracy, the presence of technology in the judicial process may also affect the public perception of the courts. In particular, if individuals are averse to adjudication that involves a high degree of automation, particularly given fairness concerns, then judicial technology may yield lower benefits than expected. However, the degree of aversion may well depend on how technology is used, i.e., on the timing and strength of judicial reliance on algorithms. Using an exploratory survey, we investigate whether the stage in which judges turn to algorithms for assistance matters for individual beliefs about the fairness of case outcomes. Specifically, we elicit beliefs about the use of algorithms in four different stages of adjudication: (i) information acquisition, (ii) information analysis, (iii) decision selection, and (iv) decision implementation. Our analysis indicates that individuals generally perceive the use of algorithms as fairer in the information acquisition stage than in other stages. However, individuals with a legal profession also perceive automation in the decision implementation stage as less fair compared to other individuals. Our findings, hence, suggest that individuals do care about how and when algorithms are used in the courts.

ID-1257,article,Art in an age of artificial intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) will affect almost every aspect of our lives and replace many of our jobs. On one view, machines are well suited to take over automated tasks and humans would remain important to creative endeavors. In this essay, I examine this view critically and consider the possibility that AI will play a significant role in a quintessential creative activity, the appreciation and production of visual art. This possibility is likely even though attributes typically important to viewers–the agency of the artist, the uniqueness of the art and its purpose might not be relevant to AI art. Additionally, despite the fact that art at its most powerful communicates abstract ideas and nuanced emotions, I argue that AI need not understand ideas or experience emotions to produce meaningful and evocative art. AI is and will increasingly be a powerful tool for artists. The continuing development of aesthetically sensitive machines will challenge our notions of beauty, creativity, and the nature of art.

ID-1267,article,"Acceptance of clinical artificial intelligence among physicians and medical students: A systematic review with cross-sectional survey
","Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) needs to be accepted and understood by physicians and medical students, but few have systematically assessed their attitudes. We investigated clinical AI acceptance among physicians and medical students around the world to provide implementation guidance.

Materials and methods
We conducted a two-stage study, involving a foundational systematic review of physician and medical student acceptance of clinical AI. This enabled us to design a suitable web-based questionnaire which was then distributed among practitioners and trainees around the world.

Results
Sixty studies were included in this systematic review, and 758 respondents from 39 countries completed the online questionnaire. Five (62.50%) of eight studies reported 65% or higher awareness regarding the application of clinical AI. Although, only 10–30% had actually used AI and 26 (74.28%) of 35 studies suggested there was a lack of AI knowledge. Our questionnaire uncovered 38% awareness rate and 20% utility rate of clinical AI, although 53% lacked basic knowledge of clinical AI. Forty-five studies mentioned attitudes toward clinical AI, and over 60% from 38 (84.44%) studies were positive about AI, although they were also concerned about the potential for unpredictable, incorrect results. Seventy-seven percent were optimistic about the prospect of clinical AI. The support rate for the statement that AI could replace physicians ranged from 6 to 78% across 40 studies which mentioned this topic. Five studies recommended that efforts should be made to increase collaboration. Our questionnaire showed 68% disagreed that AI would become a surrogate physician, but believed it should assist in clinical decision-making. Participants with different identities, experience and from different countries hold similar but subtly different attitudes.

Conclusion
Most physicians and medical students appear aware of the increasing application of clinical AI, but lack practical experience and related knowledge. Overall, participants have positive but reserved attitudes about AI. In spite of the mixed opinions around clinical AI becoming a surrogate physician, there was a consensus that collaborations between the two should be strengthened. Further education should be conducted to alleviate anxieties associated with change and adopting new technologies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9472134,1,3,2,,,,,Mingyang Chen and Bo Zhang and Ziting Cai and Samuel Seery and Maria J Gonzalez and Nasra M Ali and Ran Ren and Youlin Qiao and Peng Xue and Yu Jiang,10.3389/fmed.2022.990604,2296-858X,,Frontiers in medicine,"acceptance,artificial intelligence (AI),attitude,medical students,physicians",,,990604,,Frontiers Media SA,9,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.990604 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36117979 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9472134,2022,,

","Plain Language Summary: The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental healthcare offers a potential solution to some of the problems associated with the availability, attractiveness, and accessibility of mental healthcare services. However, there are many knowledge gaps concerning how to implement and best use AI to add value to mental healthcare services, providers, and consumers. This paper is based on a selective review of articles concerning AI in mental healthcare and implementation science, with the aim to identify challenges and opportunities for the use of AI in mental healthcare and describe key insights from implementation science of potential relevance to understand and facilitate AI implementation in mental healthcare. AI offers opportunities for identifying the patients most in need of care or the interventions that might be most appropriate for a given population or individual. AI also offers opportunities for supporting a more reliable diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and ongoing monitoring and tailoring during the course of treatment. However, AI implementation challenges exist at organizational/policy, individual, and technical levels, making it relevant to draw on implementation science knowledge for understanding and facilitating implementation of AI in mental healthcare. Knowledge derived from implementation science could provide an important starting point for research on AI implementation in mental healthcare. This field has generated many insights and provides a broad range of theories, frameworks, and concepts that are likely relevant for this research.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9924259,3,,,,,,potential advantages and concerns with using AI in mental healthcare,Per Nilsen and Petra Svedberg and Jens Nygren and Micael Frideros and Jan Johansson and Stephen Schueller,10.1177/26334895221112033,2633-4895,,Implementation research and practice,"artificial intelligence,implementation,mental health services",,,26334895221112033,,SAGE Publications,3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/26334895221112033 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37091110 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9924259,2022,,

ID-1272,article,Should I Trust the Artificial Intelligence to Recruit? Recruiters’ Perceptions and Behavior When Faced With Algorithm-Based Recommendation Systems During Resume Screening,"Resume screening assisted by decision support systems that incorporate artificial intelligence is currently undergoing a strong development in many organizations, raising technical, managerial, legal, and ethical issues. The purpose of the present paper is to better understand the reactions of recruiters when they are offered algorithm-based recommendations during resume screening. Two polarized attitudes have been identified in the literature on users’ reactions to algorithm-based recommendations: algorithm aversion, which reflects a general distrust and preference for human recommendations; and automation bias, which corresponds to an overconfidence in the decisions or recommendations made by algorithmic decision support systems (ADSS). Drawing on results obtained in the field of automated decision support areas, we make the general hypothesis that recruiters trust human experts more than ADSS, because they distrust algorithms for subjective decisions such as recruitment. An experiment on resume screening was conducted on a sample of professionals (N = 694) involved in the screening of job applications. They were asked to study a job offer, then evaluate two fictitious resumes in a 2 × 2 factorial design with manipulation of the type of recommendation (no recommendation/algorithmic recommendation/human expert recommendation) and of the consistency of the recommendations (consistent vs. inconsistent recommendation). Our results support the general hypothesis of preference for human recommendations: recruiters exhibit a higher level of trust toward human expert recommendations compared with algorithmic recommendations. However, we also found that recommendation’s consistence has a differential and unexpected impact on decisions: in the presence of an inconsistent algorithmic recommendation, recruiters favored the unsuitable over the suitable resume. Our results also show that specific personality traits (extraversion, neuroticism, and self-confidence) are associated with a differential use of algorithmic recommendations. Implications for research and HR policies are finally discussed.

ID-1274,article,Artificial Intelligence Can’t Be Charmed: The Effects of Impartiality on Laypeople’s Algorithmic Preferences,"Over the coming years, AI could increasingly replace humans for making complex decisions because of the promise it holds for standardizing and debiasing decision-making procedures. Despite intense debates regarding algorithmic fairness, little research has examined how laypeople react when resource-allocation decisions are turned over to AI. We address this question by examining the role of perceived impartiality as a factor that can influence the acceptance of AI as a replacement for human decision-makers. We posit that laypeople attribute greater impartiality to AI than human decision-makers. Our investigation shows that people value impartiality in decision procedures that concern the allocation of scarce resources and that people perceive AI as more capable of impartiality than humans. Yet, paradoxically, laypeople prefer human decision-makers in allocation decisions. This preference reverses when potential human biases are made salient. The findings highlight the importance of impartiality in AI and thus hold implications for the design of policy measures.

ID-1277,article,"Adoption of AI-Enabled Tools in Social Development Organizations in India: An Extension of UTAUT Model
","Social development organizations increasingly employ artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled tools to help team members collaborate effectively and efficiently. These tools are used in various team management tasks and activities. Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), this study explores various factors influencing employees’ use of AI-enabled tools. The study extends the model in two ways: a) by evaluating the impact of these tools on the employees’ collaboration and b) by exploring the moderating role of AI aversion. Data were collected through an online survey of employees working with AI-enabled tools. The analysis of the research model was conducted using partial least squares (PLS), with a two-step model – measurement and structural models of assessment. The results revealed that the antecedent variables, such as effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, are positively associated with using AI-enabled tools, which have a positive relationship with collaboration. It also concluded a significant effect of AI aversion in the relationship between performance expectancy and use of technology. These findings imply that organizations should focus on building an environment to adopt AI-enabled tools while also addressing employees’ concerns about AI.

ID-1279,article,Artificial Intelligence in NICU and PICU: A need for ecological validity,"Pediatric patients, particularly in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units (NICUs and PICUs), are typically at an increased risk of fatal decompensation. That being said, any delay in treatment or minor errors in medication dosage can overcomplicate patient health. Under such an environment, clinicians are expected to quickly and effectively comprehend large volumes of medical information to diagnose and develop a treatment plan for any baby. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the clinical workflow can be a potential solution to safeguard pediatric patients and augment the quality of care. However, before making AI an integral part of pediatric care, it is essential to evaluate the technology from a human factors perspective, ensuring its readiness (technology readiness level) and ecological validity. Addressing AI accountability is also critical to safeguarding clinicians and improving AI acceptance in the clinical workflow. This article summarizes the application of AI in NICU/PICU and consecutively identifies the existing flaws in AI (from clinicians’ standpoint), and proposes related recommendations, which, if addressed, can improve AIs’ readiness for a real clinical environment.

intelligence perspectives on risky medical
decisions and COVID-19: How does the
number of lives matter in clinical trials
framed as gains versus losses?","Outcomes of clinical trials need to be communicated effectively to make decisions that save lives. We investigated whether framing can bias these decisions and if risk preferences shift depending on the number of patients. Hypothetical information about two medicines used in clinical trials having a sure or a risky outcome was presented in either a gain frame (people would be saved) or a loss frame (people would die). The number of patients who signed up for the clinical trials was manipulated in both frames in all the experiments. Using an unnamed disease, lay participants (experiment 1) and would-be medical professionals (experiment 2) were asked to choose which medicine they would have administered. For COVID-19, lay participants were asked which medicine should medical professionals (experiment 3), artificially intelligent software (experiment 4), and they themselves (experiment 5) favour to be administered. Broadly consistent with prospect theory, people were more risk-seeking in the loss frames than the gain frames. However, risk-aversion in gain frames was sensitive to the number of lives with risk-neutrality at low magnitudes and risk-aversion at high magnitudes. In the loss frame, participants were mostly risk-seeking. This pattern was consistent across laypersons and medical professionals, further extended to preferences for choices that medical professionals and artificial intelligence programmes should make in the context of COVID-19. These results underscore how medical decisions can be impacted by the number of lives at stake while revealing inconsistent risk preferences for clinical trials during a real pandemic.",http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17470218211052037 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34609226,3,,,,,,,Sumitava Mukherjee and Divya Reji,10.1177/17470218211052037,1747-0218,5,Quarterly journal of experimental psychology (2006),"Asian Disease,COVID-19,Valuation of lives,framing effect,medical decision making,risk-aversion",,,784-795,,SAGE Publications,75,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17470218211052037 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34609226,2022,,
ID-1281,article,"Delegation to artificial agents fosters prosocial behaviors in the collective risk dilemma
","Home assistant chat-bots, self-driving cars, drones or automated negotiation systems are some of the several examples of autonomous (artificial) agents that have pervaded our society. These agents enable the automation of multiple tasks, saving time and (human) effort. However, their presence in social settings raises the need for a better understanding of their effect on social interactions and how they may be used to enhance cooperation towards the public good, instead of hindering it. To this end, we present an experimental study of human delegation to autonomous agents and hybrid human-agent interactions centered on a non-linear public goods dilemma with uncertain returns in which participants face a collective risk. Our aim is to understand experimentally whether the presence of autonomous agents has a positive or negative impact on social behaviour, equality and cooperation in such a dilemma. Our results show that cooperation and group success increases when participants delegate their actions to an artificial agent that plays on their behalf. Yet, this positive effect is less pronounced when humans interact in hybrid human-agent groups, where we mostly observe that humans in successful hybrid groups make higher contributions earlier in the game. Also, we show that participants wrongly believe that artificial agents will contribute less to the collective effort. In general, our results suggest that delegation to autonomous agents has the potential to work as commitment devices, which prevent both the temptation to deviate to an alternate (less collectively good) course of action, as well as limiting responses based on betrayal aversion.

In doing so, we discuss the role played by various forms of algorithmic transparency in the process of trust repair, including explanations of algorithms, uncertainty estimates, and performance metrics.

ID-1289,article,Interactive Design Psychology and Artificial Intelligence-Based Innovative Exploration of Anglo-American Traumatic Narrative Literature,"The advent of the intelligence age has injected new elements into the development of literature. The synergic modification of Anglo-American (AAL) traumatic narrative (TN) literature by artificial intelligence (AI) technology and interactive design (ID) psychology will produce new possibilities in literary creation. First, by studying natural language processing (NLP) technology, this study proposes a modification language model (LM) based on the double-layered recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm and constructs an intelligent language modification system based on the improved LM model. The results show that the performance of the proposed model is excellent; only about 30% of the respondents like AAL literature; the lack of common cultural background, appreciation difficulties, and language barriers have become the main reasons for the decline of reading willingness of AAL literature. Finally, AI technology and ID psychology are used to modify a famous TN work respectively and synergically, and the modified work is appreciated by respondents to collect their comments. The results corroborate that 62% of the respondents like original articles, but their likability scores have decreased for individually modified work by AI or ID psychology. In comparison, under the synergic modification efforts of AI and ID psychology, the popularity of the modified work has increased slightly, with 65% of the respondents showing a likability to read. Therefore, it is concluded that literary modification by single ID psychology or AI technology will reduce the reading threshold by trading off the literary value of the original work. The core of literary creation depends on human intelligence, and AI might still not be able to generate high-standard literary works independently because human minds and thoughts cannot be controlled and predicted by machines. The research results provide new ideas and improvement directions for the field of AI-assisted writing.

ID-1295,article,"Effect of having, but not consulting, a computerized diagnostic aid","Previous research has described physicians' reluctance to use computerized diagnostic aids (CDAs) but has never experimentally examined the effects of not consulting an aid that was readily available. Experiment 1. Participants read about a diagnosis made either by a physician or an auto mechanic (to control for perceived expertise). Half read that a CDA was available but never actually consulted; no mention of a CDA was made for the remaining half. For the physician, failure to consult the CDA had no significant effect on competence ratings for either the positive or negative outcome. For the auto mechanic, failure to consult the CDA actually increased competence ratings following a negative but not a positive outcome. Negligence judgments were greater for the mechanic than for the physician overall. Experiment 2. Using only a negative outcome, we included 2 different reasons for not consulting the aid and provided accuracy information highlighting the superiority of the CDA over the physician. In neither condition was the physician rated lower than when no aid was mentioned. Ratings were lower when the physician did not trust the CDA and, surprisingly, higher when the physician believed he or she already knew what the CDA would say. Finally, consistent with our previous research, ratings were also high when the physician consulted and then followed the advice of a CDA and low when the CDA was consulted but ignored. Individual differences in numeracy did not qualify these results. Implications for the literature on algorithm aversion and clinical practice are discussed.

","Rationale and objectives: This study aimed to investigate radiologists' and radiographers' knowledge, perception, readiness, and challenges regarding Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration into radiology practice.

Materials and methods: An electronically distributed cross-sectional study was conducted among radiologists and radiographers in the United Arab Emirates. The questionnaire captured the participants' demographics, qualifications, professional experience, and postgraduate training. Their knowledge, perception, organisational readiness, and challenges regarding AI integration into radiology were examined.

Results: There was a significant lack of knowledge and appreciation of the integration of AI into radiology practice. Organisations are stepping toward building AI implementation strategies. The availability of appropriate training courses is the main challenge for both radiographers and radiologists.

Conclusion: The excitement of AI implementation into radiology practise was accompanied by a lack of knowledge and effort required to improve the user's appreciation of AI. The knowledge gap requires collaboration between educational institutes and professional bodies to develop structured training programs for radiologists and radiographers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33129659,1,1,1,"medical, healthcare",,,"survey collecting radiologists' knowledge and perceptions of AI integration in radiology.

ID-1299,article,Conservatism predicts aversion to consequential Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize society by automating tasks as diverse as driving cars, diagnosing diseases, and providing legal advice. The degree to which AI can improve outcomes in these and other domains depends on how comfortable people are trusting AI for these tasks, which in turn depends on lay perceptions of AI. The present research examines how these critical lay perceptions may vary as a function of conservatism. Using five survey experiments, we find that political conservatism is associated with low comfort with and trust in AI-i.e., with AI aversion. This relationship between conservatism and AI aversion is explained by the link between conservatism and risk perception; more conservative individuals perceive AI as being riskier and are therefore more averse to its adoption. Finally, we test whether a moral reframing intervention can reduce AI aversion among conservatives.

ID-1303,article,Clinical and research medical applications of artificial intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML), has transformed numerous industries through newfound efficiencies and supportive decision-making. With the exponential growth of computing power and large datasets, AI has transitioned from theory to reality in teaching machines to automate tasks without human supervision. AI-based computational algorithms analyze ""training sets"" using pattern recognition and learning from inputted data to classify and predict outputs that otherwise could not be effectively analyzed with human processing or standard statistical methods. Though widespread understanding of the fundamental principles and adoption of applications have yet to be achieved, recent applications and research efforts implementing AI have demonstrated great promise in predicting future injury risk, interpreting advanced imaging, evaluating patient-reported outcomes, reporting value-based metrics, and augmenting telehealth. With appreciation, caution, and experience applying AI, the potential to automate tasks and improve data-driven insights may be realized to fundamentally improve patient care. The purpose of this review is to discuss the pearls, pitfalls, and applications associated with AI.

ID-1320,article,"The reliability and transparency bases of trust in human-swarm interaction: principles and implications
","Automation reliability and transparency are key factors for trust calibration and as such can have distinct effects on human reliance behaviour and mission performance. One question that remains unexplored is: what are the implications of reliability and transparency on trust calibration for human-swarm interaction? We investigate this research question in the context of human-swarm interaction, as swarm systems are becoming more popular for their robustness and versatility. Thirty-two participants performed swarm-based tasks under different reliability and transparency conditions. The results indicate that trust, whether it is reliability- or transparency-based, indicates high reliance rates and shorter response times. Reliability-based trust is negatively correlated with correct rejection rates while transparency-based trust is positively correlated with these rates. We conclude that reliability and transparency have distinct effects on trust calibration. Practitioner Summary: Reliability and transparency have distinct effects on trust calibration. Findings from our human experiments suggest that transparency is a necessary design requirement if and when humans need to be involved in the decision-loop of human-swarm systems, especially when swarm reliability is high.

ID-1322,article,The effects of personality and locus of control on trust in humans versus,"Introduction
We are increasingly exposed to applications that embed some sort of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, and there is a general belief that people trust any AI-based product or service without question. This study investigated the effect of personality characteristics (Big Five Inventory (BFI) traits and locus of control (LOC)) on trust behaviour, and the extent to which people trust the advice from an AI-based algorithm, more than humans, in a decision-making card game.

Method
One hundred and seventy-one adult volunteers decided whether the final covered card, in a five-card sequence over ten trials, had a higher/lower number than the second-to-last card. They either received no suggestion (control), recommendations from what they were told were previous participants (humans), or an AI-based algorithm (AI). Trust behaviour was measured as response time and concordance (number of participants' responses that were the same as the suggestion), and trust beliefs were measured as self-reported trust ratings.

Results
It was found that LOC influences trust concordance and trust ratings, which are correlated. In particular, LOC negatively predicted beyond the BFI dimensions trust concordance. As LOC levels increased, people were less likely to follow suggestions from both humans or AI. Neuroticism negatively predicted trust ratings. Openness predicted reaction time, but only for suggestions from previous participants. However, people chose the AI suggestions more than those from humans, and self-reported that they believed such recommendations more.

Conclusions
The results indicate that LOC accounts for a significant variance for trust concordance and trust ratings, predicting beyond BFI traits, and affects the way people select whom they trust whether humans or AI. These findings also support the AI-based algorithm appreciation.","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240584402031416X#:~:text=It%20was%20found%20that%20LOC,Neuroticism%20negatively%20predicted%20trust%20ratings.",1,1,1,,,,"locus of control as a user characteristic predicting algorithm aversion.

ID-1335,article,"A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Resistance Training on Whole-Body Muscle Growth in Healthy Adult Males
","We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to study all published clinical trial interventions, determined the magnitude of whole-body hypertrophy in humans (healthy males) and observed the individual responsibility of each variable in muscle growth after resistance training (RT). Searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from database inception until 10 May 2018 for original articles assessing the effects of RT on muscle size after interventions of more than 2 weeks of duration. Specifically, we obtain the variables fat-free mass (FMM), lean muscle mass (LMM) and skeletal muscle mass (SMM). The effects on outcomes were expressed as mean differences (MD) and a random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regressions determined covariates (age, weight, height, durations in weeks…) to explore the moderate effect related to the participants and characteristics of training. One hundred and eleven studies (158 groups, 1927 participants) reported on the effects of RT for muscle mass. RT significantly increased muscle mass (FFM+LMM+SMM; Δ1.53 kg; 95% CI [1.30, 1.76], p < 0.001; I2 = 0%, p = 1.00). Considering the overall effects of the meta-regression, and taking into account the participants' characteristics, none of the studied covariates explained any effect on changes in muscle mass. Regarding the training characteristics, the only significant variable that explained the variance of the hypertrophy was the sets per workout, showing a significant negative interaction (MD; estimate: 1.85, 95% CI [1.45, 2.25], p < 0.001; moderator: -0.03 95% CI [-0.05, -0.001] p = 0.04). In conclusion, RT has a significant effect on the improvement of hypertrophy (~1.5 kg). The excessive sets per workout affects negatively the muscle mass gain.

We find no sign of algorithm aversion: participants care about returns, but do not have strong preferences which financial intermediary obtains these returns.

ID-1341,article,Establishing the Relevance of Non-compensatory Choice Algorithms from Stated Choice Surveys--An Exploration,"In applied sciences large-scale surveys are a popular means to acquire insights in the choices that people make in different contexts. In transportation research, for example, tens of thousands stated their choices between alternatives characterized by cost and time attributes. In this study I explore the extent to which the data acquired in such studies may exhibit the co-occurrence of different choice algorithms within such survey populations. For that purpose I propose a novel version of the outcome-oriented approach. It is applied to the outcomes of two Dutch value-of-time surveys. If the recorded choice patterns are viewed apart, most could be the result of several different algorithms, in line with the main criticism of the outcome-oriented approach. The novel version considers the causal relationships between an individual's personal circumstances, his use of a particular algorithm and the resulting choice pattern. It employs inferential statistics for analyses of the frequencies of the expected and actually recorded choice patterns within groups of respondents. Applied to the Dutch survey results this allowed disentangling, at the aggregate level, the overlap in explaining compensatory and non-compensatory algorithms to a large extent. It revealed that weighted additive (WADD) algorithms incorporating different degrees of loss aversion could explain most recorded choice behaviour while none of the many non-compensatory algorithms that were considered yielded a more than marginal explanation. Replications of this study, preferably by re-analysing other large-scale surveys with more complicated choice sets, is recommended to find out whether or not these findings are incidental.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1743536&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://journal.sjdm.org",3,,,,,,,Evert Jan van de Kaa,,19302975,3,Judgment and Decision Making,"Intertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving D15,Optimization Techniques; Programming Models; Dynamic Analysis C61",5,Accession Number: 1743536; Geographic Descriptors: Netherlands; Geographic Region: Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20181213,260-279,,,12,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1743536&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://journal.sjdm.org",2017,,

ID-1345,article,A Hybrid Group Decision-Making Approach Involving Pythagorean Fuzzy Uncertainty for Green Supplier Selection,"Green supplier selection is a significant issue in green supply chain management field and has drawn worldwide attention from academia, industry, and governments. Numerous methodological models have emerged for correctly choosing an appropriate green supplier, but some inadequate aspects of these models, such as the use of high-order fuzzy uncertainty, incompatible designed criteria, the weight methods used by decision experts, and consensus on distinct ranks, should be improved. This research propounds a hybrid approach that combines the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS), and linear assignment method (LAM) under Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) uncertainty to assess candidate suppliers. A new hierarchical evaluative criteria system with green factors that run throughout procurement, production, and transaction is built. The ordered weighted averaging operation predicated on a normal distribution is adopted to figure out the significance of the relevant decision experts, and the PF-AHP technique is exploited to recognize relevant criteria significance. To find the best green supplier, the PF-TOPSIS technique employs the most recent generalized distance measure and magnitudes. The LAM is exploited to arrive at a consensus on distinct ranks depending on differentiated distance parameter values in the distance formula for the PF sets, and then the optimal green supplier can be obtained. Additionally, the presented PF-AHP-TOPSIS-LAM approach was applied to an illustrative case, and the outcomes were shown to be more beneficial and efficacious than the solutions by other existing techniques. Hence, our presented hybrid approach provides a better methodological framework, establishes a critical foundation for artificial intelligence applications within a decision support field, and contributes to such competitiveness of microenterprises and the long-term development of society.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2047520&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Fang Zhou and Ting-Yu Chen,10.1016/j.ijpe.2023.108875,9255273,,International Journal of Production Economics,"Environmental Economics: General Q50,Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope L25,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33,Transactional Relationships; Contracts and Reputation; Networks L14",7,Accession Number: 2047520; Keywords: Procurement;  Supply Chain;  Transactions; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20230622,,,,261,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2047520&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2023,,
ID-1346,article,A Multi-perspective Approach to Support Collaborative Cost Management in Supplier-Buyer Dyads,"Joint cost management is a decisive factor for sustainable collaboration in supplier-buyer dyads. For both parties the establishment of an accurate cost estimation (CE) framework supports managing suppliers' costs as well as manufacturer's quotation costing. Grounded on resource dependence theory and following a design science research approach, this study introduces a multi-perspective CE system inspired by statistical learning, deep learning, decision making, and multi-agent theory. We evaluate our system by a single case and computer simulation study, using empirical data coming from observations and archives at a large Bavarian original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The results indicate that our CE approach allows to select the most significant cost-drivers and predict total costs of parts and assemblies with high accuracy. This supports the supplier in efficiently managing its costs. In making the CE blackbox model transparent using a combination of model agnostic post-hoc explainable artificial intelligence approaches we foster user acceptance for both suppliers and OEMs. All CE artifacts are ensembled in a multi-agent system to automatically manage costs with suppliers and furthermore, as a model extension, can lead to a collaborative price agreement.

ID-1347,article,A New Approach for Identifying the Kemeny Median Ranking,"Condorcet consistent rules were originally developed for preference aggregation in the theory of social choice. Nowadays these rules are applied in a variety of fields such as discrete multi-criteria analysis, defence and security decision support, composite indicators, machine learning, artificial intelligence, queries in databases or internet multiple search engines and theoretical computer science. The cycle issue, known also as Condorcet's paradox, is the most serious problem inherent in this type of rules. Solutions for dealing with the cycle issue properly already exist in the literature; the most important one being the identification of the median ranking, often called the Kemeny ranking. Unfortunately its identification is a NP-hard problem. This article has three main objectives: (1) to clarify that the Kemeny median order has to be framed in the context of Condorcet consistent rules; this is important since in the current practice sometimes even the Borda count is used as a proxy for the Kemeny ranking. (2) To present a new exact algorithm, this identifies the Kemeny median ranking by providing a searching time guarantee. (3) To present a new heuristic algorithm identifying the Kemeny median ranking with an optimal trade-off between convergence and approximation.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1801370&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Ivano Azzini and Giuseppe Munda,10.1016/j.ejor.2019.08.033,3772217,2,European Journal of Operational Research,"Optimization Techniques; Programming Models; Dynamic Analysis C61,Social Choice; Clubs; Committees; Associations D71",3,Accession Number: 1801370; Keywords: Rules;  Social Choice; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20191114,388-401,,,281,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1801370&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2020,,
ID-1348,article,A Policy Approach to the Environmental Impacts of Technological Lock-In,"The broadening spectrum of environmental problems, the uncertainty regarding their scale and duration, and their possible irreversibility, in the context of the growing social preference for environmental quality, make it necessary to undertake an ex ante approach to the link between productive activity and environmental quality. This link lies in technology, and the right approach is to understand how the process of technological change can lead towards sustainability. The added value of Evolutionary Economics in the context of environmental policy resides mainly in the fact that it warns that certain inferior environmental technologies may be locked in to the economic system. The results of our model show that it would be advisable to undertake policies expressly aimed at the process of sustainable technological change-applying an ex ante (precautionary) approach-in a way that is complementary to the conventional equilibrium oriented environmental policies. The nature of these policies and how they might be implemented are questions we will address from this novel approach to the concept of sustainable development. In short, the main objectives of this paper are to understand more fully the dynamics of the process of technological change, its role in sustainable development, and to assess the implications of this dynamic approach to techno-environmental policy. To achieve these goals we have developed an agent-based model (ABM), using distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) concepts drawn from the general methodology of social simulation.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0877981&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Javier Carrillo-Hermosilla,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.09.001,9218009,4,Ecological Economics,"Environment and Development; Environment and Trade; Sustainability; Environmental Accounts and Accounting; Environmental Equity; Population Growth Q56,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",7,Accession Number: 0877981; Keywords: Environmental Impact;  Sustainability;  Technological Change;  Technology; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20061201,717-742,,,58,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0877981&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2006,,
ID-1349,article,Adaptive Online Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection with Transaction Costs,"Online portfolio selection is attracting increasing attention in both artificial intelligence and finance communities due to its efficiency and practicability in deriving optimal investment strategies in real investment activities where the market information is constantly renewed every second. The key issues in online portfolio selection include predicting the future returns of risky assets accurately given historical data and providing optimal investment strategies for investors in a short time. In the existing online portfolio selection studies, the historical return data of one risky asset is used to estimate its future return. In this paper, we incorporate the peer impact into the return prediction where the predicted return of one risky asset not only depends on its past return data but also the other risky assets in the financial market, which gives a more accurate prediction. An adaptive moving average method with peer impact (AOLPI) is proposed, in which the decaying factors can be adjusted automatically in the investment process. In addition, the adaptive mean-variance (AMV) model is firstly applied in online portfolio selection where the variance is employed to measure the investment risk and the covariance matrix can be linearly updated in the investment process. The adaptive online moving average mean-variance (AOLPIMV) algorithm is designed to provide flexible investment strategies for investors with different risk preferences. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness and advantages of AOLPIMV.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2094641&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rquf20",3,,,,,,,Sini Guo and Jia-Wen Gu and Wai-Ki Ching and Benmeng Lyu,10.1080/14697688.2023.2287134,14697688,1,Quantitative Finance,"Behavioral Finance: Role and Effects of Psychological, Emotional, Social, and Cognitive Factors on Decision Making in Financial Markets G41,Portfolio Choice; Investment Decisions G11",1,Accession Number: 2094641; Keywords: Finance;  Financial Market;  Portfolio; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20240411,59-82,,,24,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2094641&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rquf20",2024,,

The Extending Artificial Intelligence Robot Lawyer Technology Acceptance Model for Legal Industry by an Exploratory Study,"The development of artificial intelligence has created new opportunities and challenges in industries. The competition between robots and humans has elicited extensive attention among legal researchers. In this exploratory study, we addressed issues regarding the introduction of robots to the practice of legal service through a semistructured interviews with lawyers, judges, artificial intelligence experts, and potential clients. An extended robot lawyer technology acceptance model with five facets and 11 elements is proposed in this study. This model highlights two dimensions: 'legal use' and 'perception of trust.' In summary, this study provides new specific implications and exhibits three characteristics, namely, derivative, macroscopic, and instructive, in the legal services with artificial intelligence.

It is very relevant when AI is dramatically reshaping hiring function in the changing scenario. Design/methodology/approach: The objectives are achieved with the help of three studies involving Delphi method to explore the criteria for AI adoption decision. Followed by two multi criteria decision-making techniques, i.e., analytic hierarchy process to identify weights of the criteria and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to assess the extent of AI adoption in hiring. Findings: The findings reveal that information security and return on investment are considered two very important criteria by human resources managers while contemplating the adoption of AI in hiring process. It was found that AI adoption will be suitable at the sourcing and initial screening stages of hiring.

ID-1352,article,Algorithmic Leviathan or Individual Choice: Choosing Sanctioning Regimes in the Face of Observational Error,"Laboratory experiments are a promising tool for studying how competing institutional arrangements perform and what determines preferences between them. Reliance on enforcement by peers versus formal authorities is a key example. That people incur costs to punish free riders is a well-documented departure from non-behavioural game-theoretic predictions, but how robust is peer punishment to informational problems? We report experimental evidence that reluctance to personally impose punishment when choices are reported unreliably may tip the scales towards rule-based and algorithmic formal enforcement even when observation by the centre is equally prone to error. We provide new and consonant evidence from treatments in which information quality differs for authority versus peers, and confirmatory patterns in both binary decision and quasi-continuous decision variants. Since the role of formal authority is assumed by a computer in our experiment, our findings are also relevant to the question of willingness to entrust machines to make morally fraught decisions, a choice increasingly confronting humans in the age of artificial intelligence.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2027971&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/14680335",3,,,,,,,Thomas Markussen and Louis Putterman and Liangjun Wang,,130427,357,Economica,"Game Theory and Bargaining Theory: General C70,International Conflicts; Negotiations; Sanctions F51,Optimization Techniques; Programming Models; Dynamic Analysis C61,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33,Trade Policy; International Trade Organizations F13",1,"Accession Number: 2027971 Alternate Accession Number: EP160590386; Keywords: Game Theoretic;  Games; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20230316; Copyright: Copyright of Economica is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

We examine the impact of this trend on investment performance and the factors that led to the reliance on AI. Using data from 92 largest plans 2001-2014, we found AI, especially private equity, generally had a positive effect on investment performance, but the effect was small and unsustainable. We also found that plans with a lower funded ratio and higher investment return expectation were more likely to allocate more assets to AIs. These findings suggest that the prospect of relying on AIs to meet investment return expectations remains a long-term challenge for state and local governments.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1887756&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Jun Peng and Qiushi Wang,,14747472,4,Journal of Pension Economics and Finance,"Social Security and Public Pensions H55,State and Local Government: Health; Education; Welfare; Public Pensions H75",10,"Accession Number: 1887756 Alternate Accession Number: EP146551701; Keywords: Pension;  Public Pension; Geographic Descriptors: U.S.; Geographic Region: Northern America; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20210311; Copyright: Copyright of Journal of Pension Economics & Finance is the property of Cambridge University Press and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

ID-1354,article,An Application-Oriented Testing Regime and Multi-ship Predictive Modeling for Vessel Fuel Consumption Prediction,"Fuel consumption prediction (FCP) of vessels is the core of many decarbonization efforts by the maritime industry. Understanding the capability of machine learning (ML) FCP models is essential in various decision-making processes. However, the current model testing practice does not reflect their uncertainty and resilience in actual applications. To address this gap, this study proposes a testing regime that could provide insights into models' behaviors, dependency on different features, and potential vulnerabilities to data uncertainties in the deployment phase. Two multi-ship FCP models were developed for testing, using extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms on noon reports of a container fleet operated globally in 2.5 years. Unlike previous studies, which explicitly indicated the superior ML algorithms, results from this study depicted a complicated situation with no decisive dominance of one algorithm over another, suggesting the potential of model combination and cooperation for optimal application performance. Aiding the FCP model development efforts, this study also includes findings regarding (1) the optimal configurations for ANN models, and (2) the reliance of FCP ML models and algorithms on different fuel consumption influencing factors. To our knowledge, this study is among the first to advocate a more comprehensive understanding of AI-based FCP models' characteristics in realistic scenarios instead of simple selections based on accuracy indicators.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2066365&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Son Nguyen and Xiuju Fu and Daichi Ogawa and Qin Zheng,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103261,13665545,,Transportation Research: Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,"Climate; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Global Warming Q54,Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41,Forecasting Models; Simulation Methods C53,Neural Networks and Related Topics C45,Railroads and Other Surface Transportation L92,Transportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion; Travel Time; Safety and Accidents; Transportation Noise R41",9,Accession Number: 2066365; Keywords: Fuel;  Modeling;  Neural;  Neural Networks;  Prediction;  Ship; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20231012,,,,177,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2066365&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2023,,

In this paper, we take the perspective of job applicants and examine how they perceive the use of algorithms in selection and recruitment. Across four studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we show that people in the role of a job applicant perceive algorithm-driven recruitment processes as less fair compared to human only or algorithm-assisted human processes. This effect persists regardless of whether the outcome is favorable to the applicant or not. A potential mechanism underlying algorithm resistance is the belief that algorithms will not be able to recognize their uniqueness as a candidate.

ID-1358,article,Articulating Uneven Regional Development: Artificial Intelligence as a Tool in Development Planning,"There is an urgent need for more efficient and effective design, targeting and implementation of interventions to reduce regional imbalances in development. To do so, development agencies and practitioners need to articulate uneven regional development as regional inequalities in, and patterns of, development. The widespread popularity of composite indices like the Human Development Index has led to the acceptance of regional inequalities as a basis for intervention. However, in computing composite indices of development like the Human Development Index, information that could be of great utility to planners is lost. This is especially important when planners work on smaller spaces and several indicators of development. There is then a need to also articulate patterns of development for optimal intervention. Unfortunately, the conventional statistical methods to discern patterns in development are complex and have not found widespread acceptance like composite indices. Artificial intelligence, in particular the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map, is a user-friendly tool for development planners and practitioners to explore patterns in development. An application with several indicators over 399 Indian districts illustrates the need to study development patterns. This paper also makes clear the versatility of the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map technique in exploring these regional patterns of development.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0852816&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/cjhd20",3,,,,,,,Sashi Sivramkrishna and Ramakrushna Panigrahi,,14649888,3,Journal of Human Development,"Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure O18,Planning Models; Planning Policy O21,Regional Development Planning and Policy R58,Regional Economic Activity: Growth, Development, Environmental Issues, and Changes R11",11,"Accession Number: 0852816 Alternate Accession Number: EP11094492; Keywords: Development;  Planning;  Regional Development;  Regional; Geographic Descriptors: India; Geographic Region: Asia; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20060701; Copyright: Copyright of Journal of Human Development is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

ID-1360,article,Artificial Intelligence Classification of Wetland Vegetation Morphology Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network,"In real-world wetland vegetation morphology (WVM) detection, large scene variations such as those due to landform, vegetation, sunlight, weather, and sky, as well as camera parameter settings such as focal length and shooting angle, require systematic and complicated artificial intelligence technology to accurately discriminate inter and intra-class wetland objections. To deal with these challenges, we introduced a deep-level discriminative model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) for classifying the images of DongZhai Harbor intertidal, Lashi Lake alpine, Yancheng coastal and Zoige plateau wetlands in China. A 96-dimensional convolution operation with kernel sizes of 11 x 11 x 3 first applied to the resized 227 x 227 WVM input pictures to acquire the effective morphologic features. The perceptron layers of the rectified linear unit and the batch normalization were used in the middle layer to achieve the better gradient propagation property during the training process. The WVM features were down-sampled by the pooling networks to reduce the neuron dimensions. The fully connected layer linked to the output of the convolutional and pooling layers to obtain the high-level WVM species information for the final WVM classification purpose. The deep-level CNN-based method was compared with the traditional shallow-level feature-designed algorithms of conditional maximum entropy regression, multilayer perceptron and support vector machine. The deep-level algorithm showed the superior performance for detecting the WVM species, which provided a superior alternative routine for accurate artificial intelligence classification of WVM in the ecological engineering application. Recommendations for Resource Managers: This proposed artificial intelligence model can be used to effectively help people understand the macroscopic scene changes of ecological elements from the wetland vegetation morphology images. The detection results show the robustness of the discriminative model, for it is not affected by the complex natural factors such as landform, vegetation, sunlight, weather, and sky, as well as human factors such as camera parameter settings of focal length and shooting angle to some extent. The deep-level model based on the cascade convolution framework can be used to extract more distinguishing detailed ecological features from the original wetland vegetation morphology images compared with the shallow-level algorithms using a single convolutional layer.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1916604&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Ping Lin and Qun Lu and Du Li and Yongming Chen and Zhiyong Zou and Shanchao Jiang,,8908575,1,Natural Resource Modeling,"Ecological Economics: Ecosystem Services; Biodiversity Conservation; Bioeconomics; Industrial Ecology Q57,Economic Development: Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products O13,Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure O18,Neural Networks and Related Topics C45,Renewable Resources and Conservation: Land Q24,Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Natural Resources; Energy; Environment P28,Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Urban, Rural, and Regional Economics P25",2,"Accession Number: 1916604 Alternate Accession Number: EP141721372; Keywords: Ecological;  Neural;  Neural Networks;  Resources;  Wetlands; Geographic Descriptors: China; Geographic Region: Asia; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20210819; Copyright: Copyright of Natural Resource Modeling is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

ID-1361,article,Assessing ChatGPT's Proficiency in Quantitative Risk Management,"The purpose and novelty of this article is to investigate the extent to which artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT can grasp concepts from quantitative risk management. To this end, we enter a scholarly discussion with ChatGPT in the form of questions and answers, and analyze the responses. The questions are classics from undergraduate and graduate courses on quantitative risk management, and address risk in general, risk measures, time series, extremes and dependence. As a result, the non-technical aspects of risk (such as explanations of various types of financial risk, the driving factors underlying the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, or a basic introduction to the Basel Framework) are well understood by ChatGPT. More technical aspects (such as mathematical facts), however, are often inaccurate or wrong, partly in rather subtle ways not obvious without expert knowledge, which we point out. The article concludes by providing guidance on the types of applications for which consulting ChatGPT can be useful in order to enhance one's own knowledge of quantitative risk management (e.g., using ChatGPT as an educational tool to test one's own understanding of an already grasped concept, or using ChatGPT as a practical tool for identifying risks just not on one's own radar), and points out those applications for which the current version of ChatGPT should not be invoked (e.g., for learning mathematical concepts, or for learning entirely new concepts for which one has no basis of comparison to assess ChatGPT's capabilities).","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2066209&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.mdpi.com/journal/risks",3,,,,,,,Marius Hofert,,22279091,9,Risks,"Financing Policy; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Capital and Ownership Structure; Value of Firms; Goodwill G32,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",9,Accession Number: 2066209; Keywords: Financial Risk;  Technical; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20231012,1-29,,,11,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2066209&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.mdpi.com/journal/risks",2023,,

ID-1363,article,Aviation and the Internet--Some Legal and Economic Issues,"It is incontrovertible that, with the ravages inflicted on the world by the Covid-19 pandemic, travel by air has been vastly reduced amidst strict quarantine measures imposed on passengers. The resuscitation of air services to the volume that existed in 2019 will not only take a long time but will also require new approaches to connectivity. Trading in air transport will involve more reliance on digital technology and platforms such as the Internet that would promote communication of data and relevant details of route structures and threats posed thereto. Artificial intelligence and the Internet will be essential in providing data and details in a timely manner for both States and their airlines to take effective measures against the spread of another pandemic, the occurrence of which scientists are saying is probable in the foreseeable future. Against this backdrop of ominous reality, the aviation community has no alternative but to lean heavily on spontaneity in the exchange of information to suspend or terminate air services that connect potential hotspots that are likely to spread a virus which infects a particular city and could settle in other cities that are connected by air.

ID-1364,article,"Blockchain Economical Models, Delegated Proof of Economic Value and Delegated Adaptive Byzantine Fault Tolerance and Their Implementation in Artificial Intelligence BlockCloud","The Artificial Intelligence BlockCloud (AIBC) is an artificial intelligence and blockchain technology based large-scale decentralized ecosystem that allows system-wide low-cost sharing of computing and storage resources. The AIBC consists of four layers: a fundamental layer, a resource layer, an application layer, and an ecosystem layer (the latter three are the collective ""upper-layers""). The AIBC layers have distinguished responsibilities and thus performance and robustness requirements. The upper layers need to follow a set of economic policies strictly and run on a deterministic and robust protocol. While the fundamental layer needs to follow a protocol with high throughput without sacrificing robustness. As such, the AIBC implements a two-consensus scheme to enforce economic policies and achieve performance and robustness: Delegated Proof of Economic Value (DPoEV) incentive consensus on the upper layers, and Delegated Adaptive Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DABFT) distributed consensus on the fundamental layer. The DPoEV uses the knowledge map algorithm to accurately assess the economic value of digital assets. The DABFT uses deep learning techniques to predict and select the most suitable BFT algorithm in order to enforce the DPoEV, as well as to achieve the best balance of performance, robustness, and security. The DPoEV-DABFT dual-consensus architecture, by design, makes the AIBC attack-proof against risks such as double-spending, short-range and 51% attacks; it has a built-in dynamic sharding feature that allows scalability and eliminates the single-shard takeover. Our contribution is four-fold: that we develop a set of innovative economic models governing the monetary, trading and supply-demand policies in the AIBC; that we establish an upper-layer DPoEV incentive consensus algorithm that implements the economic policies; that we provide a fundamental layer DABFT distributed consensus algorithm that executes the DPoEV with adaptability; and that we prove the economic models can be effectively enforced by AIBC's DPoEV-DABFT dual-consensus architecture.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1868091&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.mdpi.com/journal/jrfm",3,,,,,,,Qi Deng,,19118066,4,Journal of Risk and Financial Management,"IT Management M15,Monetary Systems; Standards; Regimes; Government and the Monetary System; Payment Systems E42,Neural Networks and Related Topics C45",12,"Accession Number: 1868091 Alternate Accession Number: EP140445283; Keywords: Monetary; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20201217; Copyright: Copyright of Journal of Risk & Financial Management is the property of MDPI and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

The incredible superiority of GPT-4 is demonstrated by its ability to achieve high scores on almost all mainstream academic and professional standard exams, Copilot's capability to accomplish nearly all repetitive office work, and the rapid spread of its applications across massive areas of human society within weeks of its launch. These changes lead to the belief on the emergence of GPT-4 having a significant impact on academic research in the finance and accounting fields by establishing a consensus on the psychological acceptance of AI and rapidly eliminating technical barriers of using it.

ID-1368,article,Consumer Acceptance of the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Online Shopping: Evidence from Hungary,"The rapid development of technology has drastically changed the way consumers do their shopping. The volume of global online commerce has significantly been increasing partly due to the recent COVID-19 crisis that has accelerated the expansion of e-commerce. A growing number of webshops integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI), state-of-the-art technology into their stores to improve customer experience, satisfaction and loyalty. However, little research has been done to verify the process of how consumers adopt and use AI-powered webshops. Using the technology acceptance model (TAM) as a theoretical background, this study addresses the question of trust and consumer acceptance of Artificial Intelligence in online retail. An online survey in Hungary was conducted to build a database of 439 respondents for this study. To analyse data, structural equation modelling (SEM) was used. After the respecification of the initial theoretical model, a nested model, which was also based on TAM, was developed and tested. The widely used TAM was found to be a suitable theoretical model for investigating consumer acceptance of the use of Artificial Intelligence in online shopping. Trust was found to be one of the key factors influencing consumer attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence. Perceived usefulness as the other key factor in attitudes and behavioural intention was found to be more important than the perceived ease of use. These findings offer valuable implications for webshop owners to increase customer acceptance.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1917211&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.amfiteatrueconomic.ro/Arhiva_EN.aspx",1,1,1,e-commerce,,,,Szabolcs Nagy and Noemi Hajdu,,15829146,56,Amfiteatru Economic,"Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12,IT Management M15,Marketing M31,Retail and Wholesale Trade; e-Commerce L81",2,"Accession Number: 1917211 Alternate Accession Number: EP148509339; Keywords: Consumer;  E-Commerce;  Retail; Geographic Descriptors: Hungary; Geographic Region: Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20210826; Copyright: Copyright of Amfiteatru Economic is the property of Academia de Studii Economice and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

ID-1369,article,COVID-19 Media Chatter and Macroeconomic Reflectors on Black Swan: A Spanish and Indian Stock Markets Comparison,"Predictive analytics of financial markets in developed and emerging economies during the COVID-19 regime is undeniably challenging due to unavoidable uncertainty and the profound proliferation of negative news on different platforms. Tracking the media echo is crucial to explaining and anticipating the abrupt fluctuations in financial markets. The present research attempts to propound a robust framework capable of channeling macroeconomic reflectors and essential media chatter-linked variables to draw precise forecasts of future figures for Spanish and Indian stock markets. The predictive structure combines Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP), which is a non-linear feature transformation tool, and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), which is an ensemble machine learning technique to perform predictive modelling. The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is used to interpret the black-box type predictive model to infer meaningful insights. The overall results duly justify the incorporation of local and global media chatter indices in explaining the dynamics of respective financial markets. The findings imply marginally better predictability of Indian stock markets than their Spanish counterparts. The current work strives to compare and contrast the reaction of developed and developing financial markets during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been argued to share a close resemblance to the Black Swan event when applying a robust research framework. The insights linked to the dependence of stock markets on macroeconomic indicators can be leveraged for policy formulations for augmenting household finance.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2073363&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.mdpi.com/journal/risks",3,,,,,,,Indranil Ghosh and Esteban Alfaro-Cortes and Matias Gamez and Noelia Garcia-Rubio,,22279091,5,Risks,"Economic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; Corporate Finance and Governance O16,Equities; Fixed Income Securities G12,Financial Econometrics C58,Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44,Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11",5,Accession Number: 2073363; Keywords: Finance;  Financial Market;  Macroeconomics;  Modeling;  Stock Market;  Stocks; Geographic Descriptors: India; Spain; Geographic Region: Asia; Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20231130,1-27,,,11,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2073363&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.mdpi.com/journal/risks",2023,,
ID-1370,article,DARQ Technologies in the Financial Sector: Artificial Intelligence Applications in Personalized Banking,"Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the impact of DARQ technologies (distributed ledger, artificial intelligence, extended reality, quantum computing) in the financial sector, focusing on artificial intelligence (AI) applications in personalized banking, which consists of treating every customer as a segment of one. The research has two main goals. First, providing a complete and organic analysis of the DARQ technologies framework currently missing in the literature. Because this research focuses on the financial sector, more attention is dedicated to DARQ technologies in this industry. Second, studying applications of one of the DARQ technologies, AI, in personalized banking, where it appears to have a great potential impact. Design/methodology/approach: The research analyses both the supply side, collecting secondary data from documentation, reports and research studies to study the major trends and results obtained by leading banks, and on the demand side, collecting primary data through a dedicated survey and elaborating opinions and preferences of potential customers. Using this information, a detailed go-to-market plan based on the framework elaborated by Bain and Co. in 2012 is developed, considering the hypothesis of a well-known universal bank, operating globally, with an established brand and access to modern AI technologies, which decides to invest in this field as a priority. Findings: In addition to giving a detailed overview of DARQ technologies from a technical and a business perspective, the results related to the hypothetical case of the study help to understand which would be the most suitable target for the launch phase, which value proposition should be offered and how to deliver it, but also how to evolve the project to attract more customers and strengthen the relationship with the existing ones. Nevertheless, this research could be a starting point for future studies and updates, considering related evolutions, investigating more representative demand samples or analyzing how the combination of more DARQ technologies could be applied to the financial sector. Research limitations/implications: Some limitations affect this work. First, the topics studied are evolving rapidly and partially dependent on other innovations under development; therefore, they may become obsolete and less significant in the next years. As regard the data collection, the supply-side analysis involves strategical information kept private by companies; therefore, the collected data probably miss some useful details. As concerns primary data, the sample could have been larger and more heterogeneous and biases and misinterpretations could have affected the answers. A compromise has been found between the time and resources available and the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the sample. Practical implications: This research could be a tool for financial companies interested in investing in AI for personalized banking, but it also provides useful insights about the whole DARQ framework, which could be interesting for all the financial and nonfinancial firms. Applying AI effectively and efficiently could offer great benefits, both economic and noneconomic, to financial firms but also to their customers, who could benefit from hyper-tailored services at a reasonable and affordable price, whereas in the past, they were reserved only for very important person clients. This win-win situation could lead the way to further investments and consequent innovations in the future.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2054071&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Gimede Gigante and Anna Zago,,17554179,1,Qualitative Research in Financial Markets,"Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21,IT Management M15,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",,Accession Number: 2054071; Keywords: Bank;  Banking;  Firm;  Firms;  Technical;  Technologies; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20230727,29-57,,,15,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2054071&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2023,,
ID-1371,article,Data Localization': The Internet in the Balance,"There is a steady global trend towards ""Data Localization,"" laws by which data is required to be maintained and processed within the geographic boundaries of its state of origin. This development has raised concerns about its possible adverse impacts on emerging data-intensive technologies such as Cloud services/E-commerce, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things (collectively, the Embedded Infosphere). The inability to reach an international agreement on rules for cross-border data flows may have significant adverse consequences for all future users of the Internet. The basis of Data Localization is grounded in two distinct but inter-related policy models: Data Sovereignty and Trans-Border Data Flows. These two concepts have different origins. ""Data Sovereignty"" is derived from the historic power of a state of absolute and exclusive control within its geographic borders. Policies behind TBDFs arose in Europe following World War II, primarily motivated by Nazi use of early proto-computers to help round up Jews and others. As they have evolved, TBDF policies have been directed primarily at protecting personal data and privacy. This article first examines the issues of: 1) ""Information Sovereignty"" and 2) TBDFs. It then describes the arguments for and against ""Data Localization,"" offers some examples of strong localization policies (Russia, China), and summarizes contesting policy proposals. It then contextualizes TBDF with issues of human rights (free flow of information) and privacy. While the utility of an international agreement on TBDFs is clear, the differences in approaches are tenacious. For the free-market developed world (e.g, EU, OECD), the path forward seems to lead through policy convergence to compatible rules, with differentiated levels of data protection and accountability. It is far from clear whether these rules will address, in a mandatory way, issues of the ""free flow"" of information in the human rights sense. At the same time, there are countries (e.g., BRICS), representing a majority of the world's population, in which political and cultural resistance will produce stringent Cyber Sovereignty and Data Localization policies with few if any human rights components. The article concludes that the more the Internet is ""localized"", the more attenuated its benefits will become. The negative consequences of Data Localization will become increasingly obvious as new, data-intensive technologies become ubiquitous, creating a condition of ""Data Dependence"". It is projected that in the future the nations with the least amount of Data Localization and the most open flow of information will be the most successful in benefiting from new data-intensive embedded, networked technologies. This will most likely be characterized by values adopted as policies and practices in the EU.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1851885&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Richard D Taylor,10.1016/j.telpol.2020.102003,3085961,8,Telecommunications Policy,"Information and Internet Services; Computer Software L86,Large Data Sets: Modeling and Analysis C55,Search; Learning; Information and Knowledge; Communication; Belief; Unawareness D83",9,Accession Number: 1851885; Keywords: Information;  Services; Geographic Descriptors: EU; Selected Countries; Geographic Region: Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20200917,,,,44,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1851885&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2020,,
ID-1372,article,Data Production and the Coevolving AI Trajectories: An Attempted Evolutionary Model,"This paper contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the nature of data and the artificial intelligence (AI) technological trajectories, on the one hand, and on the dynamic processes triggered by demand during the evolution of an industry, on the other hand. We develop an agent-based model in which firms are data producers that compete on the markets for data and AI. The model is enriched by a public sector that fuels the purchase of data and trains the scientists that will populate firms as workforce. Through several simulation experiments, we analyze the determinants of each market structure, the corresponding relationships with innovation attainments, the pattern followed by labor and data productivity, the quality of data traded in the economy, and in which forms demand does affect innovation and the dynamics of industries. We question the established view in the literature of industrial organization according to which technological imperatives are enough to experience divergent industrial dynamics on both the markets for data and AI blueprints. Although technical change behooves if any industry pattern is to emerge, the actual unfolding is not the outcome of a specific technological trajectory, but the result of the interplay between technology-related factors and the availability of data-complementary inputs such as labor and AI capital, the market size, preferences, and public policies.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2079446&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Andrea Borsato and Andre Lorentz,10.1007/s00191-023-00837-3,9369937,5,Journal of Evolutionary Economics,"Computational Techniques; Simulation Modeling C63,Current Heterodox Approaches: Historical; Institutional; Evolutionary; Modern Monetary Theory B52,Data Collection and Data Estimation Methodology; Computer Programs: General C80,Innovation and Invention: Processes and Incentives O31,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",11,Accession Number: 2079446; Keywords: Evolutionary;  Innovation;  Simulation;  Technical;  Technology; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20240104,1427-1472,,,33,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2079446&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2023,,
ID-1373,article,"Data Protection, Cookie Consent, and Prices","A legislative process is currently ongoing in the European Union to supplement the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation regarding ePrivacy regulation. The supplement is intended to complete the European data protection policy in significant areas. One addition would be for service providers on the Internet, who currently obtain the consent of their users via an opt-out provision, to always provide a paid alternative without disclosing data. This procedure is essentially aimed at overcoming ""cookie consent fatigue"", which can be observed in many cases. A simple economic exchange model shows that users, as data subjects, are basically faced with the choice of paying a monetary price for a service that will also preserve their privacy or using Internet services ""for free"" while negating data privacy preferences. The individual demand for data privacy coincides with the socially optimal demand only if there is effective competition in the markets for data and Internet services and if users are sufficiently informed. In an online laboratory experiment with students of the Leuphana University of Lueneburg, a between-subjects design was applied in which the control group only had the option to either ""pay"" for the use of the artificial intelligence DeepL via cookies by surrendering data or to abstain from the service altogether, with the two treatment groups additionally given the option to use DeepL in exchange for a monetary fee so that privacy was not violated. To be tested was whether the ""monetary price for privacy"" option better reflected users' privacy preferences than the current cookie opt-out solution. The results show that it was much less common for DeepL to be remunerated with the disclosure of data and less common for DeepL to be waived entirely.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2056177&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.mdpi.com/journal/economies",3,,,,,,,Thomas Wein,,22277099,12,Economies,"Economics of Regulation L51,Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital O34,Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior D72",12,Accession Number: 2056177; Keywords: Regulation; Geographic Descriptors: Germany; Geographic Region: Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20230810,1-26,,,10,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2056177&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.mdpi.com/journal/economies",2022,,
ID-1374,article,Decision-Making in the Era of AI Support--How Decision Environment and Individual Decision Preferences Affect Advice-Taking in Forecasts,"Decision makers often receive advice from different forecast sources (e.g., human or machine), which they can integrate into their own assessments. Previous studies led to different results regarding the use of forecasts depending on their source. With the ongoing digitalization, it can be assumed, first, that forecasts will be used more frequently in general and, second, that forecasts will increasingly be created digitally or in an automated manner. To investigate these factors in more detail, a vignette experiment was conducted with over 600 participants. In particular, we focused on the decision preference of the forecast users to take a deeper look at the fit of a forecast source, decision preference, and advice-taking. The results show that both a longer time horizon as well as greater trust in advice increase the acceptance of advice. With regard to the forecast source, we find that in a long-term scenario the advice by artificial intelligence is preferred over a human advice. Concerning the relationship of trust and decision preference on the acceptance of advice, our results show that the impact of the forecast source on trust in advice is moderated by trust in digital technologies and that the moderation by trust in digital technologies is itself moderated by decision preference, which highlights the relevance of a fit between the forecast source and an individual's decision preference.",https://psycnet-apa-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/fulltext/2023-51713-001.pdf,1,1,1,,,,"time horizon as a factor.

ID-1375,article,Digital Infrastructure Policy and Digital Transformation of Enterprises: 'Empowerment' or 'Negative Energy'? (In Chinese. With English summary.),"Digital transformation has become an important strategy for the high-quality development of enterprises. However, some enterprises are caught in the dilemma of digital transformation due to the lack of transformation ability, high transformation cost, and the long, painful period of transformation. The reliance on market forces to promote the digital transformation of enterprises will face problems such as coordination failure. In this context, the issue of how to improve the role of the government in driving the digital transformation of enterprises has become a key concern in all sectors of society. With the development of digital technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and big data, local governments have introduced various policies to encourage and guide the construction of regional digital infrastructure. The implementation of such policies provides the possibility for enterprises to obtain financial and technical support for digital transformation, which will promote their digital transformation. Based on these considerations, this study focuses on the digital infrastructure policy and assesses its impact on the digital transformation of enterprises. By collecting and classifying the provincial policy texts related to digital infrastructure, this study empirically investigates the impact of digital infrastructure policy on the digital transformation of enterprises. It is found that digital infrastructure policies can significantly promote the digital transformation of enterprises. The mechanism analysis shows that digital infrastructure policies not only improve the operating conditions of enterprises, but also increase market competition and drive the development of the software and information technology service industry, which is conducive to promoting the digital transformation of enterprises. The results of the heterogeneity analysis show that digital infrastructure policies are more conducive to promoting the digital transformation of small-scale enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises. An analysis from the perspective of policy synergy shows that the digital infrastructure policy led by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) will have a more positive impact, and the effect of the policies jointly issued by multiple departments will be even more evident. The contribution of this study to existing research is mainly reflected in the following aspects. First, this study focuses on the potential impact of digital infrastructure policy on micro-enterprises, broadening the domestic research on the analysis of digital infrastructure. Second, it considers the digital transformation of enterprises as an entry point to empirically evaluate the effect of the implementation of the digital infrastructure policy. While enriching the research on the analysis of enterprise digital transformation, this study also provides a new perspective to understand the role of local governments in promoting the development of digital economy. Third, it further discusses the policy effects of different leading departments and the impact of policies jointly issued by multiple departments, allowing not only to comprehensively evaluate the practical effects of digital infrastructure policies, but also to provide useful policy reference to promote the construction of digital infrastructure in China. The conclusions of this study provide useful policy implications to promote the digital transformation of enterprises and the construction of a digital China in the new era. More in detail, the government should expand the channels for enterprises to obtain transformation funds, provide credit support for enterprises through the innovative development of the banking system, and guide enterprises to strengthen the innovation and application of digital technology by increasing government subsidies and fiscal technology expenditure, so as to promote the digital transformation of enterprises. In addition, the government should pay attention to the expansion and refinement of the digital infrastructure policies by various departments, to ensure the effectiveness of the implementation of these policies.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2053928&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Hai Wang and Zhuoyu Yan and Guanyu Guo and Junya Yin,,10003894,5,Journal of Quantitative and Technical Economics,"Formal and Informal Sectors; Shadow Economy; Institutional Arrangements O17,Industrialization; Manufacturing and Service Industries; Choice of Technology O14,National Government Expenditures and Related Policies: Infrastructures; Other Public Investment and Capital Stock H54,Production; Cost; Capital; Capital, Total Factor, and Multifactor Productivity; Capacity D24,Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Public Economics P35,Socialist and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population P23,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",,Accession Number: 2053928; Keywords: Cost;  Development;  Expenditure;  Infrastructure;  Policy;  Service Industry;  Services;  Subsidies;  Technical;  Technologies;  Technology; Geographic Descriptors: China; Geographic Region: Asia; Language: Chinese; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20230727,5-23,,,40,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2053928&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2023,,

ID-1378,article,Digital Transformation for a Sustainable Agriculture in the United States: Opportunities and Challenges,"Agriculture faces key challenges of increasing productivity while reducing adverse impacts on the environment. Conventional practices that rely on tillage, inefficient and over-application of chemicals, and monoculture row cropping are leading to growing resistance of weeds and pests to chemicals, nutrient and sediment run-off, and declining soil carbon stocks in the United States. Digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are enabling the collection of vast amounts of geo-referenced information about growing conditions within the field, automated implementation of spatially varying input applications, and reduced reliance on chemical inputs. We discuss the pathways by which digital agricultural technologies have the potential to address the challenge of herbicide-resistant weeds, over-application of nitrogen and irrigation water, and cover crop planting for restoring soil health and contribute to the environmental sustainability of agriculture. Then, we discuss the economic factors, behavioral preferences of farmers, peer pressure, and social networks that can be expected to play a role in adoption decisions. We conclude with a discussion of approaches for ex ante assessments of the determinants of farmer willingness to adopt digital technologies and their diffusion in a region.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2020342&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Madhu Khanna and Shady S Atallah and Saurajyoti Kar and Bijay Sharma and Linghui Wu and Chengzheng Yu,,1695150,6,Agricultural Economics,"Agricultural R&D; Agricultural Technology; Biofuels; Agricultural Extension Services Q16,Land Ownership and Tenure; Land Reform; Land Use; Irrigation; Agriculture and Environment Q15,Micro Analysis of Farm Firms, Farm Households, and Farm Input Markets Q12,Renewable Resources and Conservation: Land Q24,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",11,"Accession Number: 2020342 Alternate Accession Number: EP160899639; Keywords: Agriculture;  Diffusion;  Environment;  Irrigation;  Soils;  Sustainability;  Technologies;  Tillage;  Water; Geographic Descriptors: U.S.; Geographic Region: Northern America; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20230209; Copyright: Copyright of Agricultural Economics is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

ID-1380,article,Ethical Perceptions of AI in Hiring and Organizational Trust: The Role of Performance Expectancy and Social Influence,"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in hiring entails vast ethical challenges. As such, using an ethical lens to study this phenomenon is to better understand whether and how AI matters in hiring. In this paper, we examine whether ethical perceptions of using AI in the hiring process influence individuals' trust in the organizations that use it. Building on the organizational trust model and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, we explore whether ethical perceptions are shaped by individual differences in performance expectancy and social influence and how they, in turn, impact organizational trust. We collected primary data from over 300 individuals who were either active job seekers or who had recent hiring experience to capture perceptions across the full range of hiring methods. Our findings indicate that performance expectancy, but not social influence, impacts the ethical perceptions of AI in hiring, which in turn influence organizational trust. Additional analyses indicate that these findings vary depending on the type of hiring methods AI is used for, as well as on whether participants are job seekers or individuals with hiring experience. Our study offers theoretical and practical implications for ethics in HRM and informs policy implementation about when and how to use AI in hiring methods, especially as it pertains to acting ethically and trustworthily.",https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid=96111349-06c8-4403-8fe9-88e7341bc863%40redis,1,1,1,hiring,,,,Maria Figueroa-Armijos and Brent B Clark and Serge P da Motta Veiga,10.1007/s10551-022-05166-2,1674544,1,Journal of Business Ethics,"Corporate Culture; Diversity; Social Responsibility M14,Labor Turnover; Vacancies; Layoffs J63,Personnel Economics: Labor Management M54,Personnel Management; Executives; Executive Compensation M12",8,Accession Number: 2056310; Keywords: Ethical;  Ethics;  Hiring; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20230810,179-197,,,186,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2056310&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2023,,

ID-1382,article,Evaluation of Non-financial Information and Its Contribution to Advancing the Sustainable Development Goals within the Spanish Banking Sector,"Non-financial information and its contribution to the achievement of each Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) are assuming great relevance in the business world, in which it is not enough to be economically sustainable without also being sustainable from ethical, environmental, and social points of view. An analysis of how the financial sector contributes to the achievement of the SDGs is crucial in two ways. Firstly, due to the relevance and the magnitude of this sector itself; secondly, and more importantly in our view, because of the financial leverage of the banking sector that has a mandate to facilitate the transition of all economic sectors towards sustainability, guided by the 2030 Agenda. However, despite the expectations placed on banking entities, there is a research gap on their disclosure practices and on the SDG-related information that they report. In addition, the academic literature centered on the analysis of SDG-related disclosures through artificial intelligence is very scarce. To fill this gap, the objective of our study is, on the one hand, to analyze whether there is greater homogeneity in the disclosure of non-financial information in the Spanish banking sector following the transposition of Directive 2014/95/EU into Spanish Law. On the other hand, it is to evaluate the contribution of banking entities to the SDGs. To do so, the non-financial information reports of 12 Spanish banks are analyzed, completing a comparative evaluation and using artificial intelligence to identify mentions of each SDG and its targets. The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was also used to rank the banking entities in accordance with their contribution to each SDG. The results reflected the plurality, in both breadth and quality, in the disclosure of non-financial information and in the contribution to the SDGs. The only point in common between all the entities that were studied was the use of the GRI disclosure framework and the identification of the priority SDGs, positioning SDGs 8, 13, and 4 in priority positions. The banks with higher bank capitalization levels occupied the top of the ranking of contributions to the SDGs. Differences were presented for all other aspects, even to the point of highlighting that some entities or independent verifiers had not offered all the information. In conclusion, greater efforts to improve the quality of non-financial reporting and further development of the common regulatory framework will be fundamental for better comparability between the reports from banking entities. Furthermore, this study shows that natural language processing can be applied to better measure companies' alignment with the SDGs based on the text of their non-financial reports.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2023181&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Francisco Aguado-Correa and Juan Jose de la Vega-Jimenez and Jose Maria Lopez-Jimenez and Nuria Padilla-Garrido and Inmaculada Rabadan-Martin,10.1016/j.iedeen.2022.100211,24448834,1,European Research on Management and Business Economics,"Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21,Financing Policy; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Capital and Ownership Structure; Value of Firms; Goodwill G32",1,"Accession Number: 2023181 Alternate Accession Number: EP162306188; Keywords: Bank;  Banking;  Capitalization;  Leverage; Geographic Descriptors: Spain; Geographic Region: Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20230223; Copyright: Copyright of European Research on Management & Business Economics is the property of Asociacion Europea de Direccion y Economia de la Empresa (AEDEM) and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

ID-1384,article,Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Transport Logistics: Risk Analysis for Road Accidents,"Automobile traffic accidents represent a significant threat to global public safety, resulting in numerous injuries and fatalities annually. This paper introduces a comprehensive, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) artifact design, integrating accident data for utilization by diverse stakeholders and decision-makers. It proposes responsible, explanatory, and interpretable models with a systems-level taxonomy categorizing aspects of driver-related behaviors associated with varying injury severity levels, thereby contributing theoretically to explainable analytics. In the initial phase, we employed various advanced techniques such as data missing at random (MAR) with Bayesian dynamic conditional imputation for addressing missing records, synthetic minority oversampling technique for data imbalance issues, and categorical boosting (CatBoost) combined with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for determining and analyzing the importance and dependence of risk factors on injury severity. Additionally, exploratory feature analysis was conducted to uncover hidden spatiotemporal elements influencing traffic accidents and injury severity levels. We developed several predictive models in the second phase, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), deep neural networks (DNN), and fine-tuned parameters. Using the SHAP approach, we employed model-agnostic interpretation techniques to separate explanations from models. In the final phase, we provided an analysis and summary of the system-level taxonomy across feature categories. This involved classifying crash data into high-level causal factors using aggregate SHAP scores, illustrating how each risk factor contributes to different injury severity levels.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2111665&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Ismail Abdulrashid and Reza Zanjirani Farahani and Shamkhal Mammadov and Mohamed Khalafalla and Wen-Chyuan Chiang,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103563,13665545,,Transportation Research: Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,"Neural Networks and Related Topics C45,Railroads and Other Surface Transportation L92,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33,Transportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion; Travel Time; Safety and Accidents; Transportation Noise R41",6,Accession Number: 2111665; Keywords: Accident;  Logistics;  Neural;  Neural Networks;  Roads;  Safety;  Traffic;  Transport; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20240718,,,,186,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2111665&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2024,,
ID-1385,article,"Export Controls and Securitization of Economic Policy: Comparative Analysis of the Practice of the United States, the European Union, China, and Russia","National security rhetoric has gained prominence due to increasingly pervasive digitalization, the emergence of cutting-edge technologies, and developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Increased reliance on these areas fuels industrial development but also renders national economies vulnerable to foreign interference. Ultimately, the current wave of technological development with its potential threats intensifies competition between states and redefines their economic and military advantages over potential global rivals. Against this background, certain states have expanded the scope of their export control regimes by extending the lists of controlled items and/or imposing 'catch-all' control. Used in conjunction with economic sanctions, weaponized tariffs, and extensive investment screening mechanisms aimed to protect national security interests, such measures go beyond conventional non-proliferation purposes to address economic security, technological supremacy, and human rights concerns for which those states are willing to sacrifice the economic efficiency that accompanies trade liberalization. Using the United States, the European Union, China, and Russia as case studies, this article discusses to which extent different export control objectives of these international actors have been securitized. Securitization of certain states' interests is inevitable, even if not desirable. Yet, this article argues that international law can be managed to control and limit the level of securitization of domestic policies in order to strengthen the international legal system as a whole.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1993891&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Olga Hrynkiv,,10116702,4,Journal of World Trade,"Empirical Studies of Trade F14,International Conflicts; Negotiations; Sanctions F51,International Law K33,National Security; Economic Nationalism F52,Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions: International Trade, Finance, Investment, Relations, and Aid P33,Trade Policy; International Trade Organizations F13",6,Accession Number: 1993891; Keywords: Exports;  International Law;  Law;  Liberalization;  National Security;  Policy;  Sanctions;  Security;  Tariff;  Trade; Geographic Descriptors: China; EU; Russia; U.S.; Geographic Region: Asia; Europe; Northern America; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20221006,633-656,,,56,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1993891&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2022,,

The paper aims to understand whether AI solutions are perceived to have a positive impact on patient care and the clinician' work, and which factors affects the adoption of AI in healthcare. The paper draws upon key concepts of TAM (Technology Acceptance Model), adopting an exploratory approach. Semi-structured interviews with 22 clinicians from the NHS (the National Health System, in the United Kingdom) reveal that they perceive the usefulness of AI for healthcare (better efficiency, healthcare quality, and diagnostic accuracy).

ID-1387,article,Geospatial and Machine Learning Techniques for Wicked Social Science Problems: Analysis of Crash Severity on a Regional Highway Corridor,"The contention of this paper is that many social science research problems are too ""wicked"" to be suitably studied using conventional statistical and regression-based methods of data analysis. This paper argues that an integrated geospatial approach based on methods of machine learning is well suited to this purpose. Recognizing the intrinsic wickedness of traffic safety issues, such approach is used to unravel the complexity of traffic crash severity on highway corridors as an example of such problems. The support vector machine (SVM) and coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) algorithms are tested as inferential engines to predict crash severity and uncover spatial and non-spatial factors that systematically relate to crash severity, while a sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the relative influence of crash severity factors. Different specifications of the two methods are implemented, trained, and evaluated against crash events recorded over a 4-year period on a regional highway corridor in Northern Iran. Overall, the SVM model outperforms CANFIS by a notable margin. The combined use of spatial analysis and artificial intelligence is effective at identifying leading factors of crash severity, while explicitly accounting for spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity effects. Thanks to the demonstrated effectiveness of a sensitivity analysis, this approach produces comprehensive results that are consistent with existing traffic safety theories and supports the prioritization of effective safety measures that are geographically targeted and behaviorally sound on regional highway corridors.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1491624&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Meysam Effati and Jean-Claude Thill and Shahin Shabani,10.1007/s10109-015-0210-x,14355930,2,Journal of Geographical Systems,"Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure O18,Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models: Cross-Sectional Models; Spatial Models; Treatment Effect Models; Quantile Regressions; Social Interaction Models C31,Neural Networks and Related Topics C45,Transportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion; Travel Time; Safety and Accidents; Transportation Noise R41",4,"Accession Number: 1491624 Alternate Accession Number: EP101868166; Keywords: Highways;  Regional;  Safety;  Spatial;  Traffic; Geographic Descriptors: Iran; Geographic Region: Asia; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20150401; Copyright: Journal of Geographical Systems is a copyright of Springer, 2015.

Drawing on first-hand observation of this practice over several years of employment in a US multinational firm, we focus on the carbon emissions dashboard as a representative example of key problems with the dominant approach to sustainability targets in the Information Technology (IT) sector. First, the ways in which green software tools and carbon accounting distract from more substantial climate action from business. Second, the reliance on tools that reinforce the hallmarks of petroculture--energy efficiency and productivity--irrespective of resource use and materials depletion.

This paper expands the concept of intelligent machines as systems of automating labour based on robots and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, it aims to develop recommendations for improving productivity by managing competition and marketing in current global labour markets. We model the dependence of output per worker on robots' international distribution, the ease of hiring foreign labour, and the dependence on pay and productivity. As a result of this research, labour productivity is defined by human resource availability and not through automation. The study develops comprehensive guidance for economic policy in the global labour market for the medium-term period. Management implications include representing a vision for the future of workplaces drawn on the productivity benefits of different workplace models that stimulate growth in labour efficiency. The recommended concept validates how innovation and digitalisation reshape the workplace.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2082236&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Aleksandr Kljucnikov and Elena G Popkova and Bruno S Sergi,10.1016/j.jik.2023.100407,2444569X,4,Journal of Innovation and Knowledge,"Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity J24,Marketing M31,Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms L11,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",10,Accession Number: 2082236; Keywords: Automation;  Human Resources;  Labor Productivity;  Marketing;  Productivity;  Technologies; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20240125,,,,8,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2082236&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2023,,
ID-1390,article,How Trust Can Drive Forward the User Acceptance to the Technology? In-Vehicle Technology for Autonomous Vehicle,"The autonomous vehicle innovation has a potential effect on traffic and it's a widespread issue in the academic municipal. Based on its feature, autonomous vehicle is expected to improve traffic flow, reduce accidents, reduce social exclusion and improve the utility of time on travel. It is increasingly accepted that the next step to the evolution of human transportation is the replacement of human as the driver by the artificial-intelligence-capable machine. Regardless, the challenges remain especially in convincing the consumers to switch to autonomous cars despite the apparent benefits. In the past, papers highlighted individual trust toward machine as the key point to encourage acceptance of autonomous cars. This paper seeks to highlight the ethical implications of the autonomous technology and how it is related to the user acceptance of the technology. This paper reviewed recent studies on the ethical implications of the autonomous vehicle and the user acceptance of the technology. A systematic review of papers from the literature was done using Scopus, ISI and Web of Science. The results of the review have shown that the level of trust, which may vary on the sociodemographic profile of the users, has been studied as one of the factors for user acceptance. Many researchers also highlight ethical implication as an important aspect of autonomous technology that needs to be tended to. The researcher proposes that ethical implication can be an important element of user trust toward autonomous technology. Hence, there is a need to embed ethical implication as a construct for user trust leading to user acceptance model in future studies. In the line of this research review researcher was addressed the following comprehensive groups: examination of autonomous vehicle topographies and flexibility prototypes, consequences for street traffic and connectivity to substructure (specifically in the urban areas with the medium and low density), communal attitudes and apprehensions, transportable behaviour and plea, possible business models, and strategy implications. Lastly, the main objective of this research article is to recognise critical problems for the growth of an effort cluster investigation to comprehend attitudes of possible manipulators of AVs and to highpoint autonomous vehicle growth issues for Malaysian lawful agencies.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1743791&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",1,3,1,self-driving vehicles,,,,Nadia Adnan and Shahrina Md Nordin and Mohamad Ariff bin Bahruddin and Murad Ali,10.1016/j.tra.2018.10.019,9658564,,Transportation Research: Part A: Policy and Practice,"Automobiles; Other Transportation Equipment; Related Parts and Equipment L62,Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure O18,Innovation and Invention: Processes and Incentives O31,Transportation Economics: Government Pricing and Policy R48,Transportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion; Travel Time; Safety and Accidents; Transportation Noise R41",12,Accession Number: 1743791; Keywords: Accident;  Car;  Innovation;  Science;  Technology;  Traffic;  Transportation;  Urban;  Vehicles; Geographic Descriptors: Malaysia; Geographic Region: Asia; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20181213,819-836,,,118,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1743791&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2018,,

Yet in a changing world of work, the perceived risk of being replaced by a machine or an algorithm might also affect workers' decisions to gain new professional skills. Using novel survey data from representative samples of working individuals in 16 countries, this paper shows that fear of automation is positively associated with workers' intentions to invest in training activities outside their workplace.

ID-1393,article,Identifying Relevant Segments of Potential Banking Chatbot Users Based on Technology Adoption Behavior,"Purpose--Chatbot technology is expected to revolutionize customer service in financial institutions. However, the adoption of customer service chatbots in banking remains low. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify relevant segments of potential banking chatbot users based on technology adoption behavior. Design/Methodology/Approach--Data for the research was collected through an online questionnaire in Romania using the non-probability sampling method. The 287 questionnaires were analyzed using hierarchical and k-means cluster analysis. Findings and implications--The analysis revealed three distinct segments: Innovators (26%), consisting of highly educated young women employed in the business sector; the Late Majority (55%), consisting of young women with higher education degrees who work in services-related fields; and Laggards (19%), consisting of educated middle-aged men employed in the business sector. New significant differences among demographic and banking behavior variables were observed across the profiles of potential banking chatbot user segments. Limitations--The study is based on a non-probability sample collected from only one country, with a rather small sample size. Originality--Technology acceptance variables (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use), expanded to include constructs such as awareness of service, perceived privacy risk, and perceived compatibility, were found to be appropriate for customer segmentation purposes in the context of chatbot applications based on artificial intelligence. The study also revealed a new innovator demographic profile.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1978312&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.efzg.unizg.hr/market",3,,,,,,,Monika-Anetta Alt and Vizeli Ibolya,,3534790,2,Market-Trziste,"Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21,Economics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination J16,Marketing M31",,Accession Number: 1978312; Keywords: Banking;  Demographics;  Financial Institution;  Women; Geographic Descriptors: Romania; Geographic Region: Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20220721,165-183,,,33,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1978312&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.efzg.unizg.hr/market",2021,,

ID-1395,article,Improving Mineral Resource Management by Accurate Financial Management: Studying through Artificial Intelligence Tools,"In recent years, with a rise in climate change, the notion of natural resource management has received much attention worldwide. The heavy reliance of both developed and developing economies on mineral resource management (MRM) is an important aspect of the debate. Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-based financial management (FM) have transformed the day-to-day operations and management prospects of ecological resources. The present research examines the relationship between AI-based FM and MRM. The study has been done for the economy of the United States of America (USA) and the time ranges from the year 1980-2020. Firstly, the stationarity of the variables are checked using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron (PP) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests. The findings reveal that all the variables follow I(1). The BDS testing is employed for checking the non-linearity among the variables under consideration. The results verify the presence of nonlinearity. Then, the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach is used to find the asymmetric effect of FM on mineral resource rent (MRR). The findings provide evidence of an asymmetric relationship between FM and MRR. Such that the positive shock of FM is negatively related to MRR while a negative shock is positively related to MRR. Based on findings, the study suggests that the USA economy must redesign its mineral resource strategy to establish AI-based financial systems for improving MRM by assuring worker safety and efficiency in the mining industry, resulting in long-term growth.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2039256&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Xuan Peng and Saeed Mousa and Muddassar Sarfraz and Nassani Abdelmohsen A and Mohamed Haffar,10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.103323,3014207,,Resources Policy,"Labor Standards: Working Conditions J81,Mining, Extraction, and Refining: Other Nonrenewable Resources L72,Neural Networks and Related Topics C45,Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Demand and Supply; Prices Q31,Safety; Job Satisfaction; Related Public Policy J28",3,Accession Number: 2039256; Keywords: Minerals;  Mining;  Natural Resource;  Resources;  Safety; Geographic Descriptors: U.S.; Geographic Region: Northern America; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20230504,,,,81,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2039256&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2023,,

Insurers cannot precisely appreciate the weight of natural hazards because of risk dependences. Insurability under uncertainty first requires an accurate assessment of entire damages. Insured and insurers both win when premiums calculate risk properly. In such cases, coverage will be available and affordable. Using the artificial neural network--a technique rooted in artificial intelligence--insurers can predict annual natural disaster losses. There are many types of artificial neural network models. In this paper, we use the multilayer perceptron neural network, the most accommodated to the prediction task. In fact, if we provide the natural disaster explanatory variables to the developed neural network, it calculates perfectly the potential annual losses for the studied country.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1109229&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.panoeconomicus.rs/archive.php",3,,,,,,,Rim Jemli and Nouri Chtourou and Rochdi Feki,,1452595X,1,Panoeconomicus,"Climate; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Global Warming Q54,Neural Networks and Related Topics C45",,"Accession Number: 1109229 Alternate Accession Number: EP51911563; Keywords: Natural Disaster;  Neural;  Neural Networks; Geographic Descriptors: Global; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20100601; Copyright: Copyright of Panoeconomicus is the property of Economists' Association of Vojvodina and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

ID-1397,article,Incremental AI,"The usual narrative is backlash to artificial intelligence (AI). A recent study found that when judges were given decision-support, it ended up increasing disparities--not because the algorithm was biased--in fact the algorithm would have resulted in lower disparities. But the judges selectively paid attention to the algorithm, which resulted in greater disparities. This article argues for an incremental approach leveraging recent theoretical insights from social preference economics. The core insight is that judges are moral decision-makers--you're right or wrong, good or bad--and to understand what motivates these decision-makers, one might turn to self-image motives--a topic of active behavioral research in recent years. Each stage leverages motives related to the self: self-image, self-improvement, self-understanding, and ego. In stage 1, people use AI as a support tool, speeding up existing processes (for example, by prefilling forms). Once they're used to this, they can more easily accept an added functionality (Stage 2) in which AI becomes a choice monitor, pointing out choice inconsistencies and reminding the human of her prior choices in similar situations. Stage 3 elevates the AI to the role of a more general coach, providing outcome feedback on choices and highlighting decision patterns. Then, in stage 4, the AI brings in other people's decision histories and patterns, serving as a platform for a community of experts. This framework contrasts with the current framework where the AI simply recommends an optimal decision.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2088468&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ajle",3,,,,,,,Daniel L Chen,,21946086,1,Asian Journal of Law and Economics,"Optimization Techniques; Programming Models; Dynamic Analysis C61,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",,"Accession Number: 2088468 Alternate Accession Number: EP163820649; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20240307; Copyright: Copyright of Asian Journal of Law & Economics is the property of De Gruyter and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

That is, high educated people in richer countries could be against immigration and free-trade if their overall disposition to these issues is bad.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1443996&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Natalia Melgar,,19297092,1,Journal of Reviews on Global Economics,"Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12,Demographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts J11,Empirical Studies of Trade F14,Geographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers J61,Neoclassical Models of Trade F11,Single Equation Models; Single Variables: Discrete Regression and Qualitative Choice Models; Discrete Regressors; Proportions; Probabilities C25",,Accession Number: 1443996; Keywords: Free Trade;  Heckscher Ohlin;  Immigrant;  Immigration;  Individual;  Preference;  Probit;  Trade; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20140601,82-88,,,1,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1443996&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2012,,
ID-1399,article,Is Society Ready for AI Ethical Decision Making? Lessons from a Study on Autonomous Cars,"We conduct two separate experiments to study the social acceptance of AI ethical decision making. In the first experiment, we test whether there is an ""unfounded"" fear of technology. We contrast two methods to measure this fear: an indirect method that measures preferences implicitly and a direct method that measures preferences explicitly. Direct questions show that humans have an aversion to AI; however, indirect questions show that humans are not averse to the implementation of new technologies. We provide a theory to identify the cause of this discrepancy: in addition to their own preferences, subjects largely weight social preferences in direct questions. In the second experiment, we study how humans react to different ways of introducing this new technology to society and find that part of the fear of AI may be related to trust in one's government. Our results show that although individuals do not have a bias against AI, its explicit discussion may generate antagonism.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804322000556?casa_token=vqVoQHlhHMwAAAAA:2EBX4HA8N7NAUhVvU6TDNWoIfqKeBu8y8zjo3OxPpTxJM-UYOw5kdKdqZGTrMEvmigTmiV3nLA,1,1,1,moral,,,What explains the discrepancy between self-reported negative attitudes toward AI and openness to new technologies?

ID-1400,article,Machine Talk: How Verbal Embodiment in Conversational AI Shapes Consumer-Brand Relationships,"This research shows that AI-based conversational interfaces can have a profound impact on consumer-brand relationships. We develop a conceptual model of verbal embodiment in technology-mediated communication that integrates three key properties of human-to-human dialogue--(1) turn-taking (i.e., alternating contributions by the two parties), (2) turn initiation (i.e., the act of initiating the next turn in a sequence), and (3) grounding between turns (i.e., acknowledging the other party's contribution by restating or rephrasing it). These fundamental conversational properties systematically shape consumers' perception of an AI-based conversational interface, their perception of the brand that the interface represents, and their behavior in connection with that brand. Converging evidence from four studies shows that these dialogue properties enhance the perceived humanness of the interface, which in turn promotes more intimate consumer-brand relationships and more favorable behavioral brand outcomes (greater recommendation acceptance, willingness to pay a price premium, brand advocacy, and brand loyalty). Moreover, we show that these effects are reduced in contexts requiring less mutual understanding between the consumer and the brand. This research highlights how fundamental principles of human-to-human communication can be harnessed to design more intimate consumer-brand interactions in an increasingly AI-driven marketplace.",https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/50/4/742/7067749,1,1,1,e-commerce,,,"enhancing a chatbot's perceived humanness by considering communication principles: turn-taking, initiation, acknowledgement",Anouk S Bergner and Christian Hildebrand and Gerald Haubl,,935301,4,Journal of Consumer Research,"Advertising M37,Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12,Marketing M31,Micro-Based Behavioral Economics: Role and Effects of Psychological, Emotional, Social, and Cognitive Factors on Decision Making D91,Neural Networks and Related Topics C45",12,Accession Number: 2094311; Keywords: Brand;  Consumer; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20240411,742-764,,,50,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2094311&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 https://academic.oup.com/jcr/issue",2023,,
ID-1401,article,Managing Consumers' Adoption of Artificial Intelligence-Based Financial Robo-advisory Services: A Moderated Mediation Model,"Introduction/Main Objectives: This study investigates the determinants of willingness to use financial robo-advisory services. The study aims to identify the intertwined roles of perceived value, perceived risk, and perceived financial knowledge in consumers' acceptance of financial robo-advisory services. Background Problem: Fintech and AI-based applications have opened up new prospects for financial management, but studies into the adoption and implementation of robo-advisors are limited and scant. Novelty: The study offers novel insights by exploring the direct and indirect effects of perceived value and risk on consumer decisions around adopting robo-advisory services. The study also identifies other major drivers of robo-advisory service adoption and formulates a comprehensive model. Research Methods: A quantitative method using a deductive approach was applied, with PLS-SEM performed on a sample of 285 respondents from Bangladesh. The sample was gathered using a purposive sampling method. Findings/Results: Findings revealed that while relative advantage and perceived innovativeness positively affected perceived value and adoption intention, complexity negatively impacted perceived value and adoption intention. The findings also highlighted that attitude had a negative effect on perceived risk and intention to adopt robo-advisory services. The mediating impact of perceived value and risk in predicting the relationship between relative advantage, attitude and behavioral intention to adopt robo-advisory services was also identified. Moreover, the study revealed that perceived financial knowledge moderated the relationship between perceived value and behavioral intention. Conclusion: This study contributes to the existing body of literature by showing the intertwined roles of perceived value, perceived risk, and perceived financial knowledge in consumer acceptance of robo-advisory services. The study provides meaningful insights for financial institutions, and policymakers seeking to make robo-advisory services more reliable and acceptable to consumers through innovative service design and positioning.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2091136&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 https://journal.ugm.ac.id/v3/jieb/issue/archive",1,1,1,,,,,Dewan Mehrab Ashrafi,,20858272,3,Journal of Indonesian Economy and Business,"Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21,Economic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; Corporate Finance and Governance O16,Equities; Fixed Income Securities G12,IT Management M15,Industrialization; Manufacturing and Service Industries; Choice of Technology O14,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",9,Accession Number: 2091136; Keywords: Financial Institution;  Management;  Services; Geographic Descriptors: Bangladesh; Geographic Region: Asia; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20240321,270-301,,,38,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2091136&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 https://journal.ugm.ac.id/v3/jieb/issue/archive",2023,,
ID-1402,article,Mapping the Conceptual Structure of Innovation in Artificial Intelligence Research: A Bibliometric Analysis and Systematic Literature Review,"This study uses bibliometric analysis and a systematic literature review to map the conceptual structure of artificial intelligence innovations (AI-I) in the social sciences between 2000 and 2023. It explicitly focuses on non-economic aspects conducive to AI-I, namely social, technological, cultural, sustainable, personal, moral, and ethical. Our analysis reveals that 1225 articles and proceeding papers have been published, and terms such as ""technology,"" ""big data,"" ""management,"" ""performance,"" ""future,"" and ""impact"" are the most frequently used when discussing innovation and AI. According to our time-zone analysis, the last two years have shown a significant emphasis on concepts such as ""transformation,"" ""corporate social responsibility,"" and ""resource-based view."" In terms of citations, the countries that receive the highest number of references in the AI-I field are the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Australia, and China. The most prolific authors in terms of publications are David Teece, Erik Brynjolfsson, and Anjan Chatterjee. Given that most studies highlight the economic side of AI-I, we selected the most prolific 163 articles from all social science research areas. These studies legitimize the main non-economic aspects that highlight both certainties and uncertainties conducive to such innovations. Although the technological component is the most popular in our analysis of the non-economic aspects of the AI-I subfield, we find an important emphasis on ethical/moral dimensions conducive to slow innovation principles.

ID-1403,article,Measuring Behavioural Biases Affecting Real Estate Investment Decisions in India: Using IRT,"Purpose: This study aims to investigate the behavioural biases influencing the real estate market investing decisions of normal non-professional investors in India. Design/methodology/approach: As the study involves the behavioural data with polytomous response format, psychometric test- graded response model (IRT approach) was used for the study with the help of STATA 14. Multi-stage stratified sampling was used to collect a sample of 560 respondents. The study used a 14-item scale representing behavioural biases derived from two broad behavioural theories, i.e. heuristics and prospect theories. Sample characteristics were checked using SPSS 20. Pre-required assumptions for IRT (i.e. local independence and unidimensionality) were tested by CFA using AMOS 20. Findings: Five items, four of which belong to heuristics (anchoring-2, representativeness-1 and availability bias-1) and one belong to prospect theory (regret aversion) are sufficient to measure the behavioural attitude of real estate investors in the Indian scenario. Item discrimination ai ranged from 0.95 to 1.52 (average value 1.29), showing moderate discrimination power of the items. The items have done a pretty good job of assessing the lower level of agreement. For the higher level of agreement, the scale came out to be less precise, with less information and higher standard error of measurement.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1729308&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journal/ijhma",3,,,,,,,Richa Pandey and V Mary Jessica,,17538270,4,International Journal of Housing Markets and Analysis,"Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure O18,Household Saving; Personal Finance D14,Housing Supply and Markets R31,Index Numbers and Aggregation; Leading indicators C43,Micro-Based Behavioral Economics: Role and Effects of Psychological, Emotional, Social, and Cognitive Factors on Decision Making D91,Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O12,Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand R21",,Accession Number: 1729308; Keywords: Real Estate; Geographic Descriptors: India; Geographic Region: Asia; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20180920,648-668,,,11,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1729308&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journal/ijhma",2018,,
ID-1404,article,Measuring Executive Personality Using Machine-Learning Algorithms: A New Approach and Audit Fee-Based Validation Tests,"We present a novel approach for measuring executive personality traits. Relying on recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence, we utilize the IBM Watson Personality Insights service to measure executive personalities based on CEOs' and CFOs' responses to questions raised by analysts during conference calls. We obtain the Big Five personality traits--openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism--based on which we estimate risk tolerance. To validate these traits, we first demonstrate that our risk-tolerance measure varies with existing inherent and behavioural-based measures (gender, age, sensitivity of executive compensation to stock return volatility, and executive unexercised-vested options) in predictable ways. Second, we show that variation in firm-year level personality trait measures, including risk tolerance, is largely explained by manager characteristics, as opposed to firm characteristics and firm performance. Finally, we find that executive inherent risk tolerance helps explain the positive relationship between client risk and audit fees documented in the prior literature. Specifically, the effect of CEO risk-tolerance--as an innate personality trait--on audit fees is incremental to the effect of increased risk appetite from equity risk-taking incentives (Vega). Measuring executive personality using machine-learning algorithms will thus allow researchers to pursue studies that were previously difficult to conduct.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1862324&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Karel Hrazdil and Jiri Novak and Rafael Rogo and Christine Wiedman and Ray Zhang,,0306686X,3-4,Journal of Business Finance and Accounting,"Auditing M42,Behavioral Finance: Role and Effects of Psychological, Emotional, Social, and Cognitive Factors on Decision Making in Financial Markets G41,Financing Policy; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Capital and Ownership Structure; Value of Firms; Goodwill G32,Neural Networks and Related Topics C45",3,Accession Number: 1862324; Keywords: Audit;  Firm; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20201119,519-544,,,47,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1862324&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2020,,
ID-1405,article,Modelling Sovereign Credit Ratings: The Accuracy of Models in a Heterogeneous Sample,"The accuracy of sovereign credit ratings renewed interest toward sovereign credit ratings in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The controversy over the accuracies encouraged internal credit scoring systems to reduce reliance on sovereign credit ratings. By employing classification and regression trees (CART), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), Bayes Net, and Naive Bayes; we explore the prediction performance of several artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in predicting sovereign credit ratings in a heterogeneous sample. The results suggest that AI classifiers outperform the conventional statistical technique in terms of accurate prediction. According to within one notch and two notches accurate prediction measure, the prediction performances of the AI classifiers exceed 90% accuracy whereas the performance of the conventional statistical method is around 70%. The results further reveal that the prediction performance of the models declines around the threshold rating that is located between investment grade and speculative grade which is not necessarily the result of inadequacy of the models. Rather, this is potentially due to CRAs' cautious behaviour toward those countries around threshold rating which can be interpreted as the certification price of upgrading to investment grade.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1581333&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Huseyin Ozturk and Ersin Namli and Halil Ibrahim Erdal,10.1016/j.econmod.2016.01.012,2649993,,Economic Modelling,"Financial Crises G01,Forecasting Models; Simulation Methods C53,International Financial Markets G15,International Lending and Debt Problems F34,Investment Banking; Venture Capital; Brokerage; Ratings and Ratings Agencies G24",4,Accession Number: 1581333; Keywords: Financial Crisis;  Modeling;  Prediction; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20160801,469-478,,,54,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1581333&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2016,,
ID-1406,article,More Human than Human: Measuring ChatGPT Political Bias,"We investigate the political bias of a large language model (LLM), ChatGPT, which has become popular for retrieving factual information and generating content. Although ChatGPT assures that it is impartial, the literature suggests that LLMs exhibit bias involving race, gender, religion, and political orientation. Political bias in LLMs can have adverse political and electoral consequences similar to bias from traditional and social media. Moreover, political bias can be harder to detect and eradicate than gender or racial bias. We propose a novel empirical design to infer whether ChatGPT has political biases by requesting it to impersonate someone from a given side of the political spectrum and comparing these answers with its default. We also propose dose-response, placebo, and profession-politics alignment robustness tests. To reduce concerns about the randomness of the generated text, we collect answers to the same questions 100 times, with question order randomized on each round. We find robust evidence that ChatGPT presents a significant and systematic political bias toward the Democrats in the US, Lula in Brazil, and the Labour Party in the UK. These results translate into real concerns that ChatGPT, and LLMs in general, can extend or even amplify the existing challenges involving political processes posed by the Internet and social media.

ID-1408,article,"Neoclassicism, Artificial Intelligence, and the Marginalization of Ethics","The paper examines the dependence of the positivist and welfarist preference satisfaction paradigm of neoclassical economics upon an implicit functionalist philosophy of mind. Functionalism is the doctrine that mental states are strictly materialistic and understandable in cause-effect terms. An important aspect of functionalism is the multiple realizability thesis, namely, that mental states can be realized in any type of hardware, whether human brain or computer. The approach used involves investigating the fact-value distinction after Robbins in terms of the positivist meta-ethical view known as emotivism, and then explaining emotivism as inherently functionalist. Functionalist thinking itself is explained in terms of contemporary philosophy of mind. An important finding is that the preference satisfaction paradigm can be shown to be as suitable to artificial intelligence systems as to human beings. A consequence of this is that normative concerns are increasingly difficult to address in connection with the neoclassical thinking about economic agents.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0812318&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,John B Davis,,3068293,7,International Journal of Social Economics,"Economic Methodology: General B40,Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification Z13",,Accession Number: 0812318; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20060101,590-601,,,32,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0812318&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2005,,
ID-1409,article,Nonlinear Relationship between Natural Resources and Economic Growth: The Role of Frontier Technology,"Natural resources have long been considered a possible engine for economic growth in underdeveloped nations. The nonlinear relationship between natural resources and economic growth is examined, focusing on the regulating function of frontier technology in developing nations. The resource-growth link is estimated using a panel dataset of 57 developing countries from 2008 to 2019 using the System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) model. Our results show an inverse-U-shaped relationship, where initial resource availability positively influences economic growth, but increased reliance on natural resources after a certain threshold hinders economic growth. It emphasizes the need for efficient resource management and diversifying one's income sources to counteract the negative consequences of the resource curse. This study also reveals the critical part frontier technology had in determining the resource-growth link. The favorable effects of natural resources on economic growth are strengthened by frontier technology, which includes cutting-edge developments in information and communication technology, artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and sophisticated manufacturing. The research's policy repercussions highlight the value of strategic investments in emerging technologies, human capital growth, and institutional reforms. Overall, this study offers an essential new understanding of the difficulties of resource-driven economic development in developing nations.

Machine learning is being used in virtually all areas in one way or another, due to its extreme effectiveness. One such area where predictive systems have gained a lot of popularity is the prediction of football match results. This paper demonstrates our work on the building of a generalized predictive model for predicting the results of the English Premier League. Using feature engineering and exploratory data analysis, we create a feature set for determining the most important factors for predicting the results of a football match, and consequently create a highly accurate predictive system using machine learning. We demonstrate the strong dependence of our models' performances on important features. Our best model using gradient boosting achieved a performance of 0.2156 on the ranked probability score (RPS) metric for game weeks 6 to 38 for the English Premier League aggregated over two seasons (2014-2015 and 2015-2016), whereas the betting organizations that we consider (Bet365 and Pinnacle Sports) obtained an RPS value of 0.2012 for the same period. Since a lower RPS value represents a higher predictive accuracy, our model was not able to outperform the bookmaker's predictions, despite obtaining promising results.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1762784&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Rahul Baboota and Harleen Kaur,10.1016/j.ijforecast.2018.01.003,1692070,2,International Journal of Forecasting,"Sports Economics: Industry Studies Z21,Sports; Gambling; Restaurants; Recreation; Tourism L83,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",4,Accession Number: 1762784; Keywords: Betting;  Football;  Sports; Geographic Descriptors: U.K.; Geographic Region: Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20190404,741-755,,,35,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1762784&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2019,,
ID-1411,article,Prioritisation of Factors for Artificial Intelligence-Based Technology Adoption by Banking Customers in India: Evidence Using the DEMATEL Approach,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a concept of recent origin and is accepted for banking activities such as customer service, detection of fraudulent activities, and suspicious transactions. For the successful implementation of AI in the Indian context, a deep understanding is required in terms of its need and importance compared to the traditional banking system. To date, this outlook of AI has been less focused by industry practitioners and experts for the smooth flow of operational procedures in banks for developing countries, for example, India. This study aims to unearth factors and establish a relationship among the identified factors through the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach to categorize the factors and frame the cause-and-effect relationships. Fifteen factors are identified through a literature review of existing studies, and ten experts were solicited to express their outlook on this subject. The result indicated that 'Transparency of information,' 'Perceived security of AI-based technology,' 'Social influence on customer,' 'Government regulation of AI in banks,' 'Awareness level of AI,' 'Efficiency of AI system,' 'Technical requirement,' and 'Cost of AI-based technology' were causative factors that support customer acceptance and penetration of AI in banks.

ID-1412,article,Prioritization of Customers' Preferences in Islamic Banking System: An Artificial Intelligence Approach Using Kano Analysis,"Purpose: There are variety of factors that influence a customer's selection of a bank in general. However, there is a large gap in the literature that covers a customer decision to choose between an Islamic bank and a conventional one. To this end, we try to fill this gap by using a case study in Morocco to analyse factors contributing to a consumer's bank selection. Methodology: The analysis presented in the paper is using a case in Morocco and applying an artificial intelligence method using KANO analysis. We apply it in three stages. First, customers preferences are identified and classified according to their impact on customer's satisfaction. Second, a Satisfaction Increasing Index (SII) is formulated. Third, a Dissatisfaction Decreasing Index (DII) is formulated. Findings: The analysis shows that Islamic banking attributes (Provision of profit-loss sharing financing, Operating on Islamic law and principles, Staff knowledge of Islamic banking, Provision of interest-free loans) are required by customers in selecting an Islamic bank as opposed to a conventional bank. However, these requirements do not necessarily contribute to increasing customers' satisfaction.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2069130&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 https://jibm.org/table-of-contents/",3,,,,,,,Youssef Lamrani Alaoui and Adil Elfakir and Mohamed Tkiouat,,20756291,1,Journal of Islamic Business and Management,"Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21,Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12,Cultural Economics: Religion Z12,Economic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; Corporate Finance and Governance O16,Financing Policy; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Capital and Ownership Structure; Value of Firms; Goodwill G32,Household Saving, Borrowing, Debt, and Wealth G51,Other Economic Systems: Public Economics; Financial Economics P43",6,Accession Number: 2069130; Keywords: Bank;  Banking;  Consumer;  Financing;  Preference; Geographic Descriptors: Morocco; Geographic Region: Africa; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20231102,18-31,,,12,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2069130&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 https://jibm.org/table-of-contents/",2022,,
ID-1413,article,Psycho-economic Aspiration and Subjective Well-Being: Evidence from a Representative Turkish Sample,"Purpose: Previous research using the Aspiration Index (AI) suggests that intrinsic goals are positively, but extrinsic/materialistic goals are negatively associated with subjective well-being (SWB). The purpose of this paper is to extend the scope of previous research by exploring the pursuit of different goals in conjunction with SWB in a country with a culture mixing western and traditional values. Several hypotheses regarding the effects of extrinsic, intrinsic, hedonic, and self-transcendent values on SWB were tested. Design/methodology/approach: An extended AI survey was conducted among randomly selected cross-sectional sample of 878 Turkish adults in Istanbul. The survey data were analyzed to explore the relationship between 14 aspiration domains and SWB using both correlation coefficients and several different regression models. Findings: The study confirms the basic assumptions of the AI research in a Muslim society with a hybrid culture of materialistic and spiritual aspirations. The study found weak supporting evidence for the contribution of two newly added domains (i.e. aesthetic appreciation as well as honesty and fairness) to SWB, whereas the evidence for the positive contribution of intellectual life was overwhelming. Paradoxically, although the evidence from both correlation and regression coefficients supported a positive relationship between household income and SWB, after dividing the sample into two groups based on their income level, the low-income earners turned out to have relatively higher life satisfaction, holding everything else constant. More importantly, the study reveals that the impact of materialistic aspirations on SWB is still negative even if they are pursued in a hybrid culture.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1665102&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Necati Aydin,,3068293,6,International Journal of Social Economics,"Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12,Cultural Economics: Religion Z12,Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification Z13,Formal and Informal Sectors; Shadow Economy; Institutional Arrangements O17,General Welfare; Well-Being I31,Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O12",,Accession Number: 1665102; Keywords: Culture;  Households;  Well Being;  Well-being; Geographic Descriptors: Turkey; Geographic Region: Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20171001,698-714,,,44,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1665102&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2017,,
ID-1414,article,Qualitative Modelling of Credit Scoring: A Case Study in Banking,"Several modelling procedures have been suggested in the literature that aim to help credit granting decisions. Most of these utilize statistical, operational research and artificial intelligence techniques to identify patterns among past applications, in order to enable a more well-informed assessment of risk as well as the automation of credit scoring. For some types of loans, we find that the modelling procedure must permit the consideration of qualitative expert judgements concerning the performance attractiveness of the applications. In this paper, we describe in detail the various steps taken to build such a model in the context of the banking sector, using the MACBETH interactive approach. The model addresses the scoring of medium and long term loans to firms, to enable the multicriteria assignment of each application to a category which may range from rejection to acceptance with different spreads.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0818726&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Carlos A Bana e Costa and Luis Antunes Barroso and Joao Oliveira Soares,,11082976,1-2,European Research Studies,"Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21,Investment Banking; Venture Capital; Brokerage; Ratings and Ratings Agencies G24",,Accession Number: 0818726; Keywords: Banking;  Credit; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20060201,37-51,,,5,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0818726&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2002,,

ID-1416,article,Relevance of Detailed Transfer Attributes in Large-Scale Multimodal Route Choice Models for Metropolitan Public Transport Passengers,"Given the aim of increasing public transport patronage, it is important to understand how passengers perceive different trip characteristics. Most of the existing studies about public transport demand and route choice assigned a higher value of time to transfers than in-vehicle time and used a general transfer penalty to capture an average increase in the travel disutility because of the amount of transfers. However, it is likely that there are nuances to the transfer behaviour depending on specific transfer conditions that existing models do not capture and hence it is difficult to evaluate measures aimed at improving transfers to make public transport more attractive. This study presents a route choice model for the large-scale multimodal public transport network in the Greater Copenhagen Region where a variety of transfer attributes were explicitly considered within a unified model framework. The model was estimated on an extensive revealed dataset of 4,810 observed routes that made it possible to evaluate the rates of substitution of transfer related attributes. The results revealed that travellers do consider attributes for transfers such as ease of wayfinding, presence of shops and escalators at stations when choosing routes in the public transport network and this influences the attractiveness of the respective routes with a quite large range of the transfer penalty from 5.4 min compared to bus in-vehicle time for the best possible transfer to 12.1 min for the worst. Furthermore, the study revealed some differences in the preferences for transfer attributes across passengers. This suggest a quite large potential for improving transfers and hence public transport patronage focusing on the attributes of the transfers.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1896625&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Otto Anker Nielsen and Morten Eltved and Marie Karen Anderson and Carlo Giacomo Prato,10.1016/j.tra.2021.02.010,9658564,,Transportation Research: Part A: Policy and Practice,"Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12,Railroads and Other Surface Transportation L92,Transportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion; Travel Time; Safety and Accidents; Transportation Noise R41",5,Accession Number: 1896625; Keywords: Bus;  Preference;  Transport;  Vehicles; Geographic Descriptors: Denmark; Geographic Region: Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20210429,76-92,,,147,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1896625&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2021,,
ID-1417,article,Resistance to Medical Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare, but little is known about consumer receptivity to AI in medicine. Consumers are reluctant to utilize healthcare provided by AI in real and hypothetical choices, separate and joint evaluations. Consumers are less likely to utilize healthcare (study 1), exhibit lower reservation prices for healthcare (study 2), are less sensitive to differences in provider performance (studies 3A-3C), and derive negative utility if a provider is automated rather than human (study 4). Uniqueness neglect, a concern that AI providers are less able than human providers to account for consumers' unique characteristics and circumstances, drives consumer resistance to medical AI. Indeed, resistance to medical AI is stronger for consumers who perceive themselves to be more unique (study 5). Uniqueness neglect mediates resistance to medical AI (study 6), and is eliminated when AI provides care (a) that is framed as personalized (study 7), (b) to consumers other than the self (study 8), or (c) that only supports, rather than replaces, a decision made by a human healthcare provider (study 9).

ID-1418,article,Risks of Observable and Unobservable Biases in Artificial Intelligence Used for Predicting Consumer Choice,"Companies are increasingly adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) today. Recently however debates started over the risk of human cognitive biases being replicated (and scaled) by AI. Research on biases in AI predicting consumer choice is incipient and focuses on observable biases. We provide a short synthesis of cognitive biases and their potential risk of being replicated in AI-based choice prediction. We also discuss for the first time the risk of unobservable biases, which affect choice indirectly, through other biases. We exemplify this by looking at looking at three prevalent, most frequently investigated biases in consumer behaviour: extremeness aversion, regret aversion and cognitive regulatory focus (prevention- versus promotion-focus). Based on a sample of 1747 respondents, through partial least squares structural equation modelling and significance testing, we show that regret aversion (unobservable bias) significantly reduces extremeness aversion (observable bias) and mediates the influence of cognitive regulatory focus (unobservable bias).","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1917208&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.amfiteatrueconomic.ro/Arhiva_EN.aspx",3,,,,,,,Florian Teleaba and Sorin Popescu and Marieta Olaru and Diana Pitic,,15829146,56,Amfiteatru Economic,"Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12,IT Management M15,Marketing M31,Retail and Wholesale Trade; e-Commerce L81",2,"Accession Number: 1917208 Alternate Accession Number: EP148509336; Keywords: Consumer; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20210826; Copyright: Copyright of Amfiteatru Economic is the property of Academia de Studii Economice and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

ID-1419,article,Role of Culture in Water Resources Management via Sustainable Social Automated Negotiation,"Increased competitions for water resources in many regions worldwide call for cooperative approaches. The competitions are complex for humans to resolve due to numerous alternatives and different or conflicting preferences of multiple stakeholders over multiple criteria, which might even oppose desirable environmental objectives. Parties also have incomplete information about the preferences of the counterparties. Electronic negotiation, empowered by intelligent agent technology, is a combination of artificial intelligence, economics, and psychology to find beneficial joint agreements in complex paradigms such as this. This study investigates a multilateral sustainable automated negotiation among intelligent agents representing stakeholders, including the legal party 'nature' as one of the stakeholders. It defines decision criteria and alternatives in the framework of cultural factors, elicits preferences of the stakeholders regarding the criteria without their intervention using a multi-criteria decision-making method, prunes the solution space before starting the negotiation by recognizing a general social treaty, determines the multi-issue specific treaty by learning the stakeholders, and demonstrates bidding and acceptance strategies.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2035025&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Faria Nassiri-Mofakham and Michael N Huhns,10.1016/j.seps.2022.101465,380121,,Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,"Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design D82,Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification Z13,Renewable Resources and Conservation: Water Q25",4,Accession Number: 2035025; Keywords: Cultural;  Culture;  Information;  Resources;  Water; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20230413,,,,86,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2035025&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2023,,
ID-1420,article,Seeking the Investment Portfolio Efficiency Applying the Artificial Intelligence,"Research background: Stochastic information in finance and economics results from various unexpected and uncertain processes and fluctuations of financial and economic activity. It is necessary to make investment decisions in capital and exchange markets adequately. Thus stochastic models in investment are widely used. Investment decision-making problems are successfully being solved by applying artificial intelligence or similar methods. However, artificial intelligence can solve significantly broader groups of problems and tasks. To solve such kinds of problems, the focusing of artificial neurons into the effectively functioning stochastic pseudo-neural network is oriented in the proposed research. Purpose of the article: The research objective is to form an efficient investment portfolio using the historical data of financial markets and assess its results. Methods: To reach the aim of the research, the stochastic investment system based on artificial intelligence and methodology of stochastic expertise is developed. It is capable of solving the investment problems in financial markets. The system is backed up by the authors' previously developed adequate portfolio model, which solves investment problems concerning the stochastic nature of investment return and analyses three investment parameters: return, reliability, and risk. Findings and value added: The paper presents investment results in the USA stock market during the 2019-2020 time period. Based on the historical data, the investment portfolio is proposed, highlighting its generated return and reliability. The possibilities to invest in portfolios with different risk levels are disclosed, attention to the investor's risk resistance level is paid. Also, an experiment in the exchange market has been conducted. After performing experiments in capital and exchange markets, the traditional technique of investment portfolio optimal solution search has been diversified and broadened. The results of the research are useful for researchers in the field of investment, as well as for individual and institutional investors.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1962284&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.transformations.khf.vu.lt/34",3,,,,,,,Aleksandras Vytautas Rutkauskas and Viktorija Stasytyte and Raimonda Martinkute-Kauliene,,16484460,3,Transformations in Business and Economics,"Equities; Fixed Income Securities G12,Neural Networks and Related Topics C45,Pension Funds; Non-bank Financial Institutions; Financial Instruments; Institutional Investors G23,Portfolio Choice; Investment Decisions G11,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",,"Accession Number: 1962284 Alternate Accession Number: EP153909266; Keywords: Finance;  Financial Market;  Institutional Investors;  Investment Decisions;  Neural;  Neural Networks;  Portfolio;  Stock Market;  Stocks; Geographic Descriptors: U.S.; Geographic Region: Northern America; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20220505; Copyright: Copyright of Transformations in Business & Economics is the property of Vilnius University and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

ID-1421,article,Sequential Composition of Voting Rules in Multi-issue Domains,"In many real-world group decision making problems, the set of alternatives is a Cartesian product of finite value domains for each of a given set of variables (or issues). Dealing with such domains leads to the following well-known dilemma: either ask the voters to vote separately on each issue, which may lead to the so-called multiple election paradoxes as soon as voters' preferences are not separable; or allow voters to express their full preferences on the set of all combinations of values, which is practically impossible as soon as the number of issues and/or the size of the domains are more than a few units. We try to reconciliate both views and find a middle way, by relaxing the extremely demanding separability restriction into this much more reasonable one: there exists a linear order x[subscript 1] > . . . > x[subscript p] on the set of issues such that for each voter, every issue x[subscript i] is preferentially independent of x[subscript i + 1], . . . , x[subscript p] given x[subscript 1], . . . , x[subscript i - 1]. This leads us to define a family of sequential voting rules, defined as the sequential composition of local voting rules. These rules relate to the setting of conditional preference networks (CP-nets) recently developed in the Artificial Intelligence literature. Lastly, we study in detail how these sequential rules inherit, or do not inherit, the properties of their local components.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1044301&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Jerome Lang and Lirong Xia,10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2008.12.010,1654896,3,Mathematical Social Sciences,"Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior D72,Social Choice; Clubs; Committees; Associations D71",5,Accession Number: 1044301; Keywords: Election;  Rules;  Voter;  Votes;  Voting; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20090601,304-324,,,57,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1044301&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2009,,

The concerned research objective is to explore the factors which impact manufacturing throughout the world during the epidemic of Covid-19. Further, it delineates the usage of advanced digital technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics (BDA), and internet of things (IoT) to bring on solutions/approaches to evolving to pandemic-constrained manufacturing. An overall of twelve key factors is determined from extensive literature reviews which are categorized into challenges and solutions. Here, ISM methodology has been used to establish the interrelationship among identified twelve challenges and solutions. Further, MICMAC analysis has categorized them according to their driving and dependence power. The consequences display the absence of autonomous factors whilst efficient supply chain, centralized decision making, product diversification, and JIT along with revenue generation turn out to be significant dependant factors. The facilitators like digital technologies are the pre-cursors to the ultimate solution of revenue generation and termed preliminary solutions. The outcomes of this research will suggest eventual policy recommendations for industry leaders to progress manufacturing within Covid-19 constraints.

ID-1423,article,"Social Interaction, Envy, and the Basic Income: Do Remedies to Technological Unemployment Reduce Well-Being?","The present article aims to utilize some insights from behavioral and happiness economics to discuss the consequences that the introduction of an unconditional basic income to cope with technological unemployment may hold for well-being. The impact of 21st-century technological progress on employment has only just begun to make itself felt and it will take time to realize its full extent. However, the main innovation is already common knowledge: robots (and artificial intelligence) are finding their way into the production process. According to several recent (although controversial) contributions, the phenomenon is radically different from past technological revolutions and could generate high levels of unemployment, calling for innovative redistributive public policies. The present article, building on Keynes' (1930) short essay (""Economic Possibilities for Our Grand-children"") and referring to some of the principles and models of behavioral and happiness economics, focuses on the best-known of these policies, namely provision of an unconditional basic income. A series of factors--loss aversion and hedonic adaptation, the impossibility of escalating to higher-grade consumption behaviors, social interaction in the form of active and passive envy, loss of self-esteem and social stigma--are all likely to have a negative impact on well-being if an unconditional basic income that remains unchanging over time is implemented. A policy mix combining a rising basic income with other measures is therefore proposed.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1984171&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bis",3,,,,,,,Fabio D'Orlando,,21946094,1,Basic Income Studies,"General Welfare; Well-Being I31,Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions D31",6,Accession Number: 1984171; Keywords: Happiness;  Income;  Well Being;  Well-being; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20220818,53-93,,,17,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1984171&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bis",2022,,

The move is rapid and multi-faceted, extending to core functions including tax compliance and investigation activities. However, this increasing reliance on digitisation, automation and artificial intelligence raises fundamental questions concerning tax authority accountability and the ability of taxpayers to exercise their rights to take legal action in the event of defective tax administration. To date, these questions have garnered little attention in the evaluation of the merits, efficiencies and goals of the push to digitise and automate.

New technologies and solutions appear every day, but the backbone of the development of the Logistics 4.0 concept is comprised of several key technologies, such as: Internet of Things (IoT), Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGV), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), Big data, Data mining, Blockchain, Cloud Computing (CC), 3D printing, etc. The aim of this paper was to define and describe in detail the aforementioned technologies, as well as the possibilities of their application in the logistics systems and processes through a review of the relevant literature in this field. It can be concluded that logistics, as a multidisciplinary science, represents a fertile ground for the acceptance and further development of existing modern technologies, but also the initiator and incubator of new technologies that could easily go beyond logistics and become part of the family of Industry 4.0 solutions.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2060487&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 https://www.ses.org.rs/casopis/arhiva-radova",3,,,,,,,Mladen Krstic and Snezana Tadic and Slobodan Zecevic,,0353443X,5-6,Ekonomika preduzeca,"Intertemporal Firm Choice: Investment, Capacity, and Financing D25,Organization of Production L23,Transactional Relationships; Contracts and Reputation; Networks L14",9,Accession Number: 2060487; Keywords: Networking; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20230831,385-401,,,69,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2060487&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 https://www.ses.org.rs/casopis/arhiva-radova",2021,,
ID-1426,article,Technology Adoption in Mining: A Multi-criteria Method to Select Emerging Technology in Surface Mines,"The integration of technologies across the mining value chain is becoming critical, and it is crucial to identify the best possible technologies applicable to an operation, based on the chosen criteria. This study investigates the adoptable technologies for a mining project, develops a conceptual framework for the analytical process and validates the framework using a hypothetical case study. The case study comprised of a technology decision problem, the result of which consisted of six technology alternatives, four criteria, and one decision maker. Of the several Multi-Criterial Decision Making (MCDM) techniques available, the fusion of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and preference ranking organisation method of enrichment (PROMETHEE) techniques were used for this study. The AHP was used to determine the hierarchal weight of each decision-making criterion and its consistency, while the PROMETHEE method was used to carry out the overall process evaluation. Additionally, the fuzzy set theory was infused into the hierarchical structure analysis to evaluate the quantitative economic criterion to curb uncertainty and imprecision. The results of the analysis show that the technology alternative A3-Artificial Intelligence (AI)--is the most preferred alternative, which outranks other comparative technologies. The approach proposed in this study can help provide the basis for any technology adopting mining company to build its technology business case, strategy and or roadmap to achieve the desired outcome.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1874286&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Oluwatobi Dayo-Olupona and Bekir Genc and Moshood Onifade,10.1016/j.resourpol.2020.101879,3014207,,Resources Policy,"Industry Studies: Primary Products and Construction: General L70,Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: General Q30,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",12,Accession Number: 1874286; Keywords: Mines;  Mining;  Technologies;  Technology;  Technology Adoption; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20210128,,,,69,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1874286&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2020,,
ID-1427,article,The Academic Industry's Response to Generative Artificial Intelligence: An Institutional Analysis of Large Language Models,"This paper examines academic institutions' heterogeneous initial responses to generative AI (GAI) tools like ChatGPT and factors influencing increased acceptance over time. GAI's disruptive nature coupled with uncertainty about impacts poses adoption challenges. However, external pressures from stakeholders seeking GAI integration contribute to changing attitudes. Actions of institutional change agents also drive growing acceptance by increasing awareness of GAI advantages. They challenge prevailing logics emphasizing assessments, proposing new values around employability and job performance. Additionally, academic institutions reevaluating GAI's value creation potential through applications and evolving business models contributes to favorable responses. The paper proposes an institutional theory framework explaining dynamics underpinning academic institutions' assimilation of GAI. It highlights how various mechanisms like external pressures, institutional entrepreneurs' theorization efforts justifying technology use, and internal sensemaking shape institutional norms and values, enabling academic systems' adaptation. The study informs policy and practice while directing future research toward validating propositions empirically and examining contextual dimensions including industry characteristics affecting GAI adoption.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2110738&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Nir Kshetri,10.1016/j.telpol.2024.102760,3085961,5,Telecommunications Policy,"Education: Government Policy I28,Entrepreneurship L26,Higher Education; Research Institutions I23,Management of Technological Innovation and R&D O32,Neural Networks and Related Topics C45",6,Accession Number: 2110738; Keywords: Adaptation;  Policy;  Technology; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20240711,,,,48,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2110738&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2024,,
ID-1428,article,The ICT Revolution and Neo-liberalism: Its Major Pathologies and a Polanyian Second Movement,"Why are we in the entangled chaos in the advanced world, in particular in the US and UK? It is argued that neo-liberalism is at the core of the explanation, but in a complex way. Some major ""liberalizing"" framework change was needed in the 1980s and 1990s to loosen the protective hold of large Fordist corporations and established financial institutions to enable the changes the ICT revolution held out to take place; this was Thatcher's strategy and bitterly opposed by much of the British capitalist elite. The paper focusses on the US (and the UK in minor key) as the driver of radical innovation. Over time major problematic pathologies have emerged in the neoliberal agenda. It is argued that these pathologies are responsible, directly and indirectly, for most of our contemporary problems: for deep segregation in British and American society, especially between large successful cities and smaller urban areas, between graduates and non-graduates, and in public services; in the growth of inequality; for the steep slowdown in innovation, productivity and real wage growth (especially in the UK); for development of populism; and for the current nervousness over AI. The core problems, it is posited, stem from the withdrawal of the state and the over-reliance on markets. Examining the different aspects of the neoliberal agenda, the possibility of a Polanyian double movement is discussed; and in this context the (ambivalent) role that democracy may play is discussed.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1886490&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.rivisteweb.it/issn/0392-9701",3,,,,,,,David Soskice,,3929701,118,Stato e Mercato,"Capitalist Systems: Political Economy P16,Industrial Policy; Sectoral Planning Methods L52,Innovation and Invention: Processes and Incentives O31,Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior D72,Technological Change: Government Policy O38",4,Accession Number: 1886490; Keywords: Democracy;  Fordist;  Innovation; Geographic Descriptors: U.K.; U.S.; Geographic Region: Europe; Northern America; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20210304,17-39,,,,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1886490&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.rivisteweb.it/issn/0392-9701",2020,,
ID-1429,article,The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Consumers' Identity and Human Skills,"The development of artificial intelligence is one of the main paradigms of the contemporary society, which will radically change the existence of individuals and our society and it will have important effects on the economy. The use of artificial intelligence in the daily work of individuals and in the relationship between companies and consumers has a great number of advantages such as the increased efficiency, a high degree of fascination in interaction, but in the same time there are several fears related to its development in the future. Due to its great data storage capacity about the behavior of individuals and the processing speed of this data, there is a risk that the forms of artificial intelligence will become smarter than humans and thus intervene in the decisions made by them. Through the constant use of artificial intelligence, there is a high risk of manipulation of consumers as well as a high degree of dependence on intelligent technologies. This close relationship between the user and artificial intelligence can reduce an individual's cognitive abilities and can affect their thinking, personality and relationships with its social circle. This paper presents a mediation model between the efficiency and fascination with artificial intelligence and the consumers' perception of preserving their self-identity and human skills, having as mediator the influence and model of the social circle. The research results show that a higher degree of efficiency and fascination, as well as a positive influence from the social circle decrease the consumers' perception of reduction of human skills in relation to artificial intelligence. Moreover, the social circle mediates the relationship between efficiency and fascination produced by artificial intelligence and the perception of preserving human abilities.",https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/281558/1/1793738041.pdf,1,1,1,,efficiency,,,Corina Pelau and Irina Ene and Mihai-Ionut Pop,,15829146,56,Amfiteatru Economic,"Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12,IT Management M15,Marketing M31,Retail and Wholesale Trade; e-Commerce L81",2,"Accession Number: 1917204 Alternate Accession Number: EP148509332; Keywords: Consumer;  Individual; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20210826; Copyright: Copyright of Amfiteatru Economic is the property of Academia de Studii Economice and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

ID-1430,article,The Importance of Social Learning for Non-market Valuation,"Neoclassical valuation methods often measure the contribution that non-market goods make to utility as income compensations. This circumvents Arrow's impossibility (AI)--a theoretical proof establishing the impossibility of social preferences--but those methods cannot be used in all settings. We build on Arrow's original proof, showing that with two additional axioms that allow for social learning, a second round of preference elicitation with a social announcement after the first, generates logically consistent social preferences. In short: deliberation leads to convergence. A 'web-game' aligning with this is trialed to select real world projects, in a deliberative way, with the board of an Australian Aboriginal Corporation. Analysis of the data collected in the trial validates our theory; our test for convergence is statistically significant at the 1% level. Our results also suggest complex social goods are relatively undervalued without deliberation. Most non-market valuation methods could be easily adapted to facilitate social learning.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1780078&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Daniel Grainger and Natalie Stoeckl,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.05.019,9218009,,Ecological Economics,"Economic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Language; Social and Economic Stratification Z13,Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination J15,Game Theory and Bargaining Theory: General C70,Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions D31",10,Accession Number: 1780078; Keywords: Aboriginal;  Games;  Income; Geographic Descriptors: Australia; Geographic Region: Oceania; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20190808,,,,164,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1780078&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2019,,
ID-1431,article,The International Movements of Capital and Labour: A Study of Foreign Direct Investment and Migration Flows,"Objective: The study seeks to analyse the interaction of foreign direct investment, emigration, and immigration before and after the great economic recession. Research Design and Methods: We used the Linear Mixed Model (LMM) to analyse interaction of foreign direct investment (FDI), emigration, and immigration for 112 countries with which Spain has closely interconnected migratory and investment chains, and we focused on the analysis of both the pre-crisis 1998-2007 and post-crisis 2008-2016 periods. Findings: The results show that the higher number of immigrants in Spain is related to an overall higher Spanish FDI flows toward the immigrants' origin countries. This relation between migration and FDI might be sustained in the long run as opposed to what was often raised in classical approaches. In fact, migration and FDI act like two sides of the same coin. Implications and Recommendations: Based on our results, we propose more proactive migration policies that support integration in host countries, migrants' return to home countries, and also trade agreements as an instrument that endorses selective FDI flow to more productive and critical sectors in home countries. Moreover, our results show that lower FDI is usually associated with a higher volume of emigration from Spain. Contribution and Value Added: In a sense, FDI and migration may be considered a risk aversion strategy.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1915886&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Antonio Mihi-Ramirez and Jesus Arteaga-Ortiz and Sara Ojeda-Gonzalez,,2353883X,3,Entrepreneurial Business and Economics Review,"Demographic Economics: Public Policy J18,Economic Integration F15,Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination J15,Financial Crises G01,International Migration F22,Multinational Firms; International Business F23",9,Accession Number: 1915886; Keywords: Emigration;  FDI;  Foreign Direct Investment;  Immigrant;  Immigration;  Integration;  Migrant;  Migration;  Trade; Geographic Descriptors: Spain; Geographic Region: Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20210819,143-160,,,7,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1915886&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2019,,

I begin by arguing that digitization and internet-enabled platforms, together with automated licensing of user-generated content, have substantially lowered the costs of individual-level cultural participation. I discuss how the dependence on advertising revenues may affect this dynamic and highlight some implications for the economics of copyright. Next, I discuss circumstances under which market data, which have become much less expensive to collect at more fine-grained levels, can trigger differentiation of cultural products. Finally, I speculate about the economic implications of artificial intelligence that complements, or perhaps substitutes for human creativity with regard to cultural participation, copyright and the industrial organization of culture.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1772978&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Christian Peukert,10.1007/s10824-018-9336-2,8852545,2,Journal of Cultural Economics,"Advertising M37,Cultural Economics: Economics of the Arts and Literature Z11,Entertainment; Media L82,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",6,"Accession Number: 1772978 Alternate Accession Number: EP136505361; Keywords: Advertising;  Cultural;  Culture;  Differentiation;  Industrial Organization;  Technological Change; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20190613; Copyright: Journal of Cultural Economics is a copyright of Springer, 2019.

ID-1433,article,The Politics of Artificial Intelligence Regulation and Governance Reform in the European Union,"This paper explores political drivers and policy process of the reform of the framework for Artificial Intelligence regulation and governance in the European Union (EU). Since 2017, the EU has been developing an integrated policy to tighten control and to ensure consumer protection and fundamental rights. This policy reform is theoretically interesting, raising the question of which conceptual approaches better explain it, and it is also empirically relevant, addressing the link between risk regulation and digital market integration in Europe. This paper explores the policy reform mainly by using two case study methods--process tracing and congruence procedure--using a variety of primary and secondary sources. It evaluates the analytical leverage of three theoretical frameworks and a set of derived testable hypotheses concerning the co-evolution of global economic competition, institutional structure, and policy preferences of domestic actors in shaping incremental approach to AI regulation in the EU. It is argued that all three are key drivers shaping the reform and explain the various stages of the policymaking process, namely problem definition, agenda-setting, and decision-making, as well as the main features of the outcome.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1955493&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Ronit Justo-Hanani,10.1007/s11077-022-09452-8,322687,1,Policy Sciences,"Consumer Protection D18,Economics of Regulation L51,Microeconomic Policy: Formulation, Implementation, and Evaluation D04,Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior D72",3,"Accession Number: 1955493 Alternate Accession Number: EP155874080; Keywords: Agenda Setting;  Consumer;  Consumer Protection;  Politic;  Political;  Protection;  Regulation;  Rights; Geographic Descriptors: EU; Geographic Region: Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20220407; Copyright: Policy Sciences is a copyright of Springer, 2022.

For understanding the behavior of state-level and national-level government agencies involved in DRO, this study grounds its theoretical arguments on the civic voluntarism model (CVM) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). Design/methodology/approach: We collected the primary data for this study from government agencies involved in DRO in India. To test the proposed theoretical model, we administered an online survey questionnaire to 184 government agency employees. To test the hypotheses, we employed partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: Our findings confirm that resources (time, money and skills) significantly influence the behavioral intentions related to the adoption of AI tools for DRO.

Fintech disruption is a deviation from the norm, resulting in a significant shift in banking services and, as a result, risk. This article aims to investigate how Fintech has influenced recent changes in the banking industry and upcoming challenges, with a particular emphasis on blockchain technology. We perform a comprehensive thematic analysis of recent studies on Fintech in the banking industry. We found that Fintech has enormous potential to grow and impact the banking industry and the entire world. The banking industry could benefit from combining emerging technologies such as blockchain, AI, machine learning, or other decision-making layers. However, with the benefits come drawbacks, such as increased reliance on technology, high costs, increased job losses, security risks related to data and fraud, and so on. The use of emerging technology and collaboration between Fintech firms and banks can improve system-wide financial stability while minimising the negative externalities of disruption and competition. These findings can help regulators, policymakers, academics, and practitioners understand the opportunities and challenges of emerging technologies in the banking industry.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2080019&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.mdpi.com/journal/risks",3,,,,,,,Parminder Varma and Shivinder Nijjer and Kiran Sood and Simon Grima and Ramona Rupeika-Apoga,,22279091,10,Risks,"Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21,IT Management M15",10,Accession Number: 2080019; Keywords: Bank;  Banking;  Finance;  Firm;  Firms; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20240111,1-17,,,10,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2080019&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://www.mdpi.com/journal/risks",2022,,
ID-1436,article,Total Factor Productivity Growth in Pakistan's Agriculture: 1960-1996,"Limits to further expansion of cultivated land and slowing returns to further input intensification accord a central role to productivity growth in meeting the challenges of agricultural growth in the future. There have not been many studies measuring total factor productivity growth in Pakistan's agriculture. The most frequently applied techniques for measuring total factor productivity growth in agriculture are: (a) Arithmetic Index (AI); and (b) Tornqvist-Theil Index (TTI). Total Factor Productivity in this study has been estimated using both the Arithmetic and the Tornqvist-Theil indexing methodologies. It has been shown that the Tornqvist-Theil indexing procedure is more appropriate due to dependence of results for the Arithmetic index on the weights used. The TFP index for the period 1960-96 is computed with a gross output index that includes both crops and livestock products and the aggregate input index that, in addition to land, capital, and labour, also includes purchased intermediate inputs (fertilisers and pesticides). The results show that the TFP has grown at an average annual rate of 2.3 percent for the entire period (1960-61 to 1995-96). This accounts for about 58 percent of the total output growth in the country during this period. It is fair to say that productivity growth was a significant driving force in the performance of the agriculture sector in Pakistan for over 36 years. The chief source of growth in TFP has been the technological progress embodied in the high-yielding varieties of grains and cotton with supporting public investment in irrigation, agricultural research and extension (R&E), and physical infrastructure. Sustaining and improving on this productivity performance of Pakistan's agriculture requires a strengthening and deepening of the agricultural markets and enhanced funding for the agricultural research system.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0864399&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://pide.org.pk/",3,,,,,,,Shujat Ali,,309729,4,Pakistan Development Review,"Agriculture: Aggregate Supply and Demand Analysis; Prices Q11,Economic Development: Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products O13,Production; Cost; Capital; Capital, Total Factor, and Multifactor Productivity; Capacity D24",,Accession Number: 0864399; Keywords: Agriculture;  Factor Productivity;  Productivity; Geographic Descriptors: Pakistan; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20060901,493-512,,,43,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0864399&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 http://pide.org.pk/",2004,,

ID-1438,article,Trade and Innovation Policies: Coexistence and Spillovers,"The debate over trade's role in growth and inequality in recent years seems to center on the question of whether the gains from trade are worth the disruption from necessary adjustments. In particular static gains from trade for advanced economies are generally estimated to be small, while empirical evidence around growing employment and inequality challenges suggest trade's role may be larger than previously thought, though still only one of many contributing factors. The focus on static gains though likely understates substantially the dynamic gains, as trade's role in spurring faster economic growth, in both developed and developing countries through competitive and innovative forces. The dynamic, competition and innovation angle suggests a need for industrial policies to be revisited and examine how spillovers play out in the global economy. At the same time significant technological disruption is occurring through digital technology, big data, and machine learning/AI techniques that often require advanced capabilities and have significant competition implications. In recent COVID-19 pandemic policy responses governments have dramatically increased spending and liquidity to support stressed firms and households and encouraged many countries to consider strategic efforts to build certain domestic capabilities with the aim of reducing dependence on trade for emergency related goods and services. This paper provides insights on the specific role of innovation policies, and they differ from and are similar to traditional industrial policies, and what that might mean for future trade rules.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1911589&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Marc Auboin and Robert Koopman and Ankai Xu,10.1016/j.jpolmod.2021.02.010,1618938,4,Journal of Policy Modeling,"Economic Growth of Open Economies F43,Empirical Studies of Economic Growth; Aggregate Productivity; Cross-Country Output Convergence O47,Health: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health I18,Innovation and Invention: Processes and Incentives O31,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33,Technological Change: Government Policy O38,Trade Policy; International Trade Organizations F13",7,Accession Number: 1911589; Keywords: Economic Growth;  Growth;  Innovation;  Policy;  Technology;  Trade; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20210715,844-872,,,43,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1911589&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2021,,

The prospect of exploring policing demand, deployment and their interplay is opened through the utilisation of big data and artificial intelligence and their integration with administrative and open data sources in a generalised method of moments (GMM) multilevel model. The research finds that policing demand and deployment hold varying and time-sensitive association with features of the urban environment. Moreover, we find that the complexities embedded in policing demands serve to shape both the cumulative and marginal resources expended in their address. Beyond their substantive policy relevance, these findings serve to open new avenues for urban criminological research centred on the consideration of the interplay between policing demand and deployment.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1974850&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/usj",3,,,,,,,Mark Ellison and Jon Bannister and Won Do Lee and Muhammad Salman Haleem,,420980,15,Urban Studies,"Criminal Law K14,Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law K42,Public Sector Labor Markets J45,Regional Economic Activity: Growth, Development, Environmental Issues, and Changes R11",11,Accession Number: 1974850; Keywords: Crime;  Policing;  Urban; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20220630,3157-3175,,,58,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1974850&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/usj",2021,,
ID-1440,article,Understanding the Choice of Human Resource and the Artificial Intelligence: 'Strategic Behavior' and the Existence of Industry Equilibrium,"Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an input to the production of goods and services. Therefore, a general question is there that ""How the labor hour/human resource will be replaced by the artificial intelligence?"" To answer this question, the paper considers that both AI and the human resources (HR) are the inputs to the firm and explains the choice between the two with reference to the customer relationship management. The paper derives the individual firms and the industry demand functions of the AI and the HR when both are present in the production of the identical or closely related goods and services. Moreover, the paper also shows the strategic behavior of an individual firm with the industry in selecting the AI and the HR. It has been shown that the individual firm's choice in the industry depends on the choice of the industry leader. The paper explains the supermodular game between the firms in an industry. Design/methodology/approach: Game theory, industrial organization and non-convexity theories have been used in this paper to identify the choice between the HR and the AI in the customer relationship management. Findings: The paper explains analytically the preference and demand for AI in the industry. Individual firm's strategic behavior and decision on choosing AI and the industry equilibrium have been studied logically. Moreover, the paper gives some light on the question of employment in presence of AI. The paper proves that in the presence of AI, labor demand will not be reduced but both will be used.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2039042&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",3,,,,,,,Dipankar Das,,1443585,2,Journal of Economic Studies,"Firm Behavior: Theory D21,Human Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity J24,Labor Demand J23,Time Allocation and Labor Supply J22",,Accession Number: 2039042; Keywords: Equilibrium;  Firm;  Firms;  Human Resources;  Labor Demand;  Production; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20230504,234-267,,,50,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2039042&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798",2023,,
ID-1441,article,Understanding the Consumer Dynamics of AI in North Macedonian E-business,"Research Purpose: This study investigates the dynamics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in e-business, particularly from the perspective of consumers in North Macedonia. The research aims to identify and evaluate the benefits and challenges of AI integration in e-business, explore the ethical concerns related to AI decision-making, and understand the impact of AI on consumer behaviour and preferences. Design/Methodology/Approach: The research adopts a mixed-methods approach, integrating qualitative and quantitative analyses. Primary data was collected via a structured questionnaire distributed among various demographic groups to gauge the level of awareness and experiences with AI in e-business. A range of statistical tests, including ANOVA and correlation tests, were employed to assess the significance of the data collected and to test a set of hypotheses concerning consumer perceptions and experiences of AI. Findings: The results reveal that demographic factors such as age, status, education, and occupation do not significantly impact the level of understanding, awareness, or experiences with AI among Macedonian consumers. Participants exhibited a level of high awareness of the importance of AI in e-business and rated their shopping experiences with AI more positively than traditional methods. Trust and reliability in AI did not significantly differ across demographic lines. The findings of this study have significant policy implications, especially in guiding the ethical and responsible integration of AI in e-business. They suggest a need for policies emphasising consumer data protection and privacy, given the heightened awareness and concern among consumers regarding using their personal information. Furthermore, the results advocate for the development of regulatory frameworks that ensure transparency and fairness in AI algorithms, addressing potential biases that could negatively impact consumer trust. Originality/Value/Practical Implications: This research contributes novel insights into the Macedonian consumer market's perception of AI in e-business, a topic scarcely covered in existing literature. The findings underscore the necessity for businesses to adopt AI responsibly and ethically, highlighting the importance of prioritising fairness, privacy, and transparency to leverage AI's full potential in e-business. This study stands out in its exploration of AI in e-business from the consumer perspective in North Macedonia, a context not extensively covered in existing literature. The originality of our research lies in its focus on a comprehensive range of consumer-centric factors, including awareness, experiences, ethical concerns, and behaviour related to AI in e-business.","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2090677&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 https://sciendo.com/journal/JEC",3,,,,,,,Saso Josimovski and Lidija Pulevska Ivanovska and Darko Dodevski,,22560173,2,Economics and Culture,"Micro-Based Behavioral Economics: Role and Effects of Psychological, Emotional, Social, and Cognitive Factors on Decision Making D91,Retail and Wholesale Trade; e-Commerce L81,Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes O33",12,Accession Number: 2090677; Geographic Descriptors: Macedonia; Geographic Region: Europe; Publication Type: Journal Article; Update Code: 20240321,64-75,,,20,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2090677&site=ehost-live&authtype=ip,sso&custid=s4392798 https://sciendo.com/journal/JEC",2023,,
ID-1442,article,Using Machine Learning Algorithms for Forecasting Rate of Return Product in Reverse Logistics Process,"Many textile products are in reverse logistics network due to mistakes made in activities such as sales forecasting, inventory planning and distribution. In order to reduce resource usage and cost at first step, in addition to producing the correct quantity, these products must be sent to branches, in correct properties (amount, color, size, model . . .) and transportation planning and stock planning should be done correctly. Statistical methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning methods are used because of the difficulty of establishing mathematical models in multi-parameter and multi-variable problems. In general, all these activities are based on demand forecasts by time series, but there are important differences between these demand predictions and the actual demands because of fashion and consumers' requests change very quickly. Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods provide faster and more accurate results in complex data sets. The difference of this study from other studies is to estimate the product return rates in Reverse Logistics with Machine Learning. In this direction, it is aimed to predict the claims accurately by concentrating on the customers' preferences, their reasons and the replies of the products which are sold to the customers. Thus, the consumer information obtained as a result of these analyzes can provide us with more accurate planning in terms of avoiding unnecessary production, transportation and storage activities, and sending the products with the correct properties; amount, color, size and model, to the branches.

ID-1443,article,People Perceive Algorithmic Assessments as Less Fair and Trustworthy Than Identical Human Assessments,"Algorithmic risk assessments are being deployed in an increasingly broad spectrum of domains including banking, medicine, and law enforcement. However, there is widespread concern about their fairness and trustworthiness, and people are also known to display algorithm aversion, preferring human assessments even when they are quantitatively worse. Thus, how does the framing of who made an assessment affect how people perceive its fairness? We investigate whether individual algorithmic assessments are perceived to be more or less accurate, fair, and interpretable than identical human assessments, and explore how these perceptions change when assessments are obviously biased against a subgroup. To this end, we conducted an online experiment that manipulated how biased risk assessments are in a loan repayment task, and reported the assessments as being made either by a statistical model or a human analyst. We find that predictions made by the model are consistently perceived as less fair and less interpretable than those made by the analyst despite being identical. Furthermore, biased predictive errors were more likely to widen this perception gap, with the algorithm being judged even more harshly for making a biased mistake. Our results illustrate that who makes risk assessments can influence perceptions of how acceptable those assessments are – even if they are identically accurate and identically biased against subgroups. Additional work is needed to determine whether and how decision aids should be presented to stakeholders so that the inherent fairness and interpretability of their recommendations, rather than their framing, determines how they are perceived",https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ashton/pubs/fairversion-cscw2023.pdf,1,1,1,"loan application, risk assessment",,,"provides a nice overview of key characteristics of the existing empirical research: who makes predictions vs. what is being predicted; performance vs. actions vs. perceptions; concrete situations vs. generic use with/without information about performance. 2 (agent: human or AI) x 2 (biased against a subgroup or not) design. participants to evaluate whether the predictor was accurate, fair, interpretable, and trustworthy in real life.

ID-1444,article,Who is the Expert? Reconciling Algorithm Aversion and Algorithm,"The increased use of algorithms to support decision making raises questions about whether people prefer algorithmic or human input when making decisions. Two streams of research on algorithm aversion and algorithm appreciation have yielded contradicting results. Our work attempts to reconcile these contradictory findings by focusing on the framings of humans and algorithms as a mechanism. In three decision making experiments, we created an algorithm appreciation result (Experiment 1) as well as an algorithm aversion result (Experiment 2) by manipulating only the description of the human agent and the algorithmic agent, and we demonstrated how different choices of framings can lead to inconsistent outcomes in previous studies (Experiment 3). We also showed that these results were mediated by the agent's perceived competence, i.e., expert power. The results provide insights into the divergence of the algorithm aversion and algorithm appreciation literature. We hope to shift the attention from these two contradicting phenomena to how we can better design the framing of algorithms. We also call the attention of the community to the theory of power sources, as it is a systemic framework that can open up new possibilities for designing algorithmic decision support systems.

ID-1445,article,Regulating Generative AI: A Pathway to Ethical and Responsible Implementation,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more prevalent in our daily lives, and its potential applications are practically limitless. However, as with any technology, there are concerns about how AI could be misused or abused. One of the most serious concerns is the potential for discrimination, particularly against women or minorities, when AI systems are used for tasks like job hiring. Additionally, there are concerns about privacy and security, as AI could be used to monitor people's movements or launch cyberattacks. To address these concerns, regulations must be developed to ensure that AI is developed and used ethically and responsibly. These regulations should address issues like safety, privacy, security, and discrimination. Finally, it is important to educate the public about AI and how to use it safely and responsibly. In this paper, I will examine the AI regulations and challenges that exist today, particularly in the United States. Two regulations I will focus on are the AI in Government Act of 2020 and the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020. Additionally, I will examine two Executive Orders that have addressed the issue of AI in the federal government. This paper examines AI generative tools, such as Bing, Bard, and Chat-GPT.

Concerns surrounding the adverse impacts of these technologies have spurred discussion on the topics of algorithmic harm. However, the overwhelming majority of articles on said harms offer no definition as to what constitutes ‘harm’ in these contexts. This paper aims to address this omission by introducing one criterion for a suitable account of algorithmic harm. More specifically, we follow Joel Feinberg in understanding harms as distinct from wrongs, where only the latter necessarily carry a normative dimension. This distinction highlights issues in the current scholarship surrounding the conflation of algorithmic harms and wrongs. In response to these issues, we put forth two requirements for upholding the harms/wrongs distinction when analyzing the increasingly far-reaching impacts of these technologies and suggest how this distinction can be useful in design, engineering, and policymaking.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630106.3659001,3,,,,,,,Nathalie Diberardino and Clair Baleshta and Luke Stark,10.1145/3630106.3659001,,,,"algorithmic harms,algorithmic wrongs,artificial intelligence,bias,design,fairness,policy",,,1725-1732,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630106.3659001,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

Yet, the degree of overlap between notions of algorithmic bias and fairness on the one hand, and legal notions of discrimination and equality on the other, is often unclear, leading to misunderstandings between computer science and law. What types of bias and unfairness does the law address when it prohibits discrimination? What role can fairness metrics play in establishing legal compliance? In this paper, we aim to illustrate to what extent European Union (EU) non-discrimination law coincides with notions of algorithmic fairness proposed in computer science literature and where they differ. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we analyse seminal examples of algorithmic unfairness through the lens of EU non-discrimination law, drawing parallels with EU case law. Second, we set out the normative underpinnings of fairness metrics and technical interventions and compare these to the legal reasoning of the Court of Justice of the EU. Specifically, we show how normative assumptions often remain implicit in both disciplinary approaches and explain the ensuing limitations of current AI practice and non-discrimination law.

Drawing inspiration from an Explainable AI approach called explanatory debugging used in interactive machine learning, our work explores designing interpretable and interactive human-in-the-loop interfaces that allow ordinary end-users without any technical or domain background to identify potential fairness issues and possibly fix them in the context of loan decisions. Through workshops with end-users, we co-designed and implemented a prototype system that allowed end-users to see why predictions were made, and then to change weights on features to “debug” fairness issues. We evaluated the use of this prototype system through an online study. To investigate the implications of diverse human values about fairness around the globe, we also explored how cultural dimensions might play a role in using this prototype.

While their recommendations converge on a set of central values, little is known about the values a more representative public would find important for the AI technologies they interact with and might be affected by. We conducted a survey examining how individuals perceive and prioritize responsible AI values across three groups: a representative sample of the US population (N=743), a sample of crowdworkers (N=755), and a sample of AI practitioners (N=175). Our results empirically confirm a common concern: AI practitioners’ value priorities differ from those of the general public. Compared to the US-representative sample, AI practitioners appear to consider responsible AI values as less important and emphasize a different set of values. In contrast, self-identified women and black respondents found responsible AI values more important than other groups. Surprisingly, more liberal-leaning participants, rather than participants reporting experiences with discrimination, were more likely to prioritize fairness than other groups.

ID-1454,inproceedings,Strategic Best Response Fairness in Fair Machine Learning,"While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been increasingly used for decision-making, issues related to discrimination in AI/ML have become prominent. While several fair algorithms are proposed to alleviate these discrimination issues, most of them provide fairness by imposing constraints to eliminate disparity in prediction results. However, the use of these fair algorithms may change the behavior of prediction subjects. As such, even though the disparity in prediction results might be removed by fair algorithms, behavioral responses to the use of fair algorithms can still create disparity in behavior which may persist across different groups of prediction subjects. To study this issue, we define a notion called ""strategic best-response fairness"" (SBR-fair). It is defined in a context that includes different groups of prediction subjects who are ex-ante identical in terms of abilities and conditional payoffs. We utilize a game-theoretic model to investigate whether different types of fair algorithms lead to identical equilibrium behaviors among different groups of prediction subjects. If yes, such an algorithm is considered SBR-fair. We then demonstrate that many existing fair algorithms are not SBR-fair. As a result, implementing these algorithms may impose fairness on prediction results but actually induce disparity between privileged and unprivileged individuals in the long run.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3514094.3534194,3,,,,,,,Hajime Shimao and Warut Khern-am-nuai and Karthik Kannan and Maxime C Cohen,10.1145/3514094.3534194,,,,"fair machine learning,game-theoretic model,strategic best response",,,664,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3514094.3534194,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1455,inproceedings,Along the Margins: Marginalized Communities' Ethical Concerns about Social Platforms,"In this paper, we identified marginalized communities' ethical concerns about social platforms. We performed this identification because recent platform malfeasance indicates that software teams prioritize shareholder concerns over user concerns. Additionally, these platform shortcomings often have devastating effects on marginalized populations. We first scraped 586 marginalized communities' subreddits, aggregated a dataset of their social platform mentions and manually annotated mentions of ethical concerns in these data. We subsequently analyzed trends in the manually annotated data and tested the extent to which ethical concerns can be automatically classified by means of natural language processing (NLP). We found that marginalized communities' ethical concerns predominantly revolve around discrimination and misrepresentation, and reveal deficiencies in current software development practices. As such, researchers and developers could use our work to further investigate these concerns and rectify current software flaws.In this paper, we identified marginalized communities' ethical concerns about social platforms. We did this because recent platform wrongdoing indicates that software teams prioritize profit over user concerns. Additionally, these platform shortcomings often have devastating effects on marginalized populations. To accomplish this, we collected Reddit posts from marginalized communities' subreddits where users mention social media platforms. Then, we labeled whether posts contained mentions of ethical concerns, like privacy or misinformation. Finally, we established trends within the resulting data and used artificial intelligence (AI) to find these ethical concerns automatically. We discovered that marginalized communities' ethical concerns revolve around discrimination and misrepresentation, among other problems, and reveal deficiencies in current social platforms. As such, researchers and software engineers could use our work to further investigate these concerns and rectify present software flaws.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1109/ICSE-SEIS58686.2023.00013,3,,,,,,,Lauren Olson and Emitzá Guzmán and Florian Kunneman,10.1109/ICSE-SEIS58686.2023.00013,,,,"communities,ethics,feedback,marginalized,reddit,software",,,71-82,,IEEE Press,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1109/ICSE-SEIS58686.2023.00013,2023,,
ID-1456,inproceedings,Censorship of Online Encyclopedias: Implications for NLP Models,"While artificial intelligence provides the backbone for many tools people use around the world, recent work has brought to attention that the algorithms powering AI are not free of politics, stereotypes, and bias. While most work in this area has focused on the ways in which AI can exacerbate existing inequalities and discrimination, very little work has studied how governments actively shape training data. We describe how censorship has affected the development of Wikipedia corpuses, text data which are regularly used for pre-trained inputs into NLP algorithms. We show that word embeddings trained on Baidu Baike, an online Chinese encyclopedia, have very different associations between adjectives and a range of concepts about democracy, freedom, collective action, equality, and people and historical events in China than its regularly blocked but uncensored counterpart - Chinese language Wikipedia. We examine the implications of these discrepancies by studying their use in downstream AI applications. Our paper shows how government repression, censorship, and self-censorship may impact training data and the applications that draw from them.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3442188.3445916,3,,,,,,,Eddie Yang and Margaret E Roberts,10.1145/3442188.3445916,,,,"censorship,machine learning,training data,word embeddings",,,537-548,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3442188.3445916,2021,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1457,inproceedings,Covid-19 Detection Using Chest Computed Tomography Scans on Ecuadorian Patients Who Live in the Highland Region,"The early detection of COVID-19 is one of the current challenges in developing effective diagnosis and treatment mechanisms for patients who are at a high risk for community contagion. Computed Tomography (CT) is an essential support for detecting the infection pattern that causes this disease. CT scans provide relevant information on the morphological appearance of the infected parenchymal tissue, known as ground-glass opacities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can assist in the quick evaluation of CT scans to differentiate COVID-19 findings in suggestive clinical cases. In this context, AI in the form of, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), has achieved successful results in the analysis and classification of medical images. A deep CNN architecture is proposed in this study to diagnose COVID-19 based on the classification of Chest Computed Tomography (CCT) images. In this study 8,624 CCTs of Ecuadorian patients affected by COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2021, were examined. The initial review of CCTs was performed by medical experts to discriminate the CCTs against other chronic lung diseases not associated with COVID-19. The CCTs were pre-processed by techniques such as morphological segmentation, erosion, dilation, and adjustment.

ID-1458,inproceedings,What People Think AI Should Infer From Faces,"Faces play an indispensable role in human social life. At present, computer vision artificial intelligence (AI) captures and interprets human faces for a variety of digital applications and services. The ambiguity of facial information has recently led to a debate among scholars in different fields about the types of inferences AI should make about people based on their facial looks. AI research often justifies facial AI inference-making by referring to how people form impressions in first-encounter scenarios. Critics raise concerns about bias and discrimination and warn that facial analysis AI resembles an automated version of physiognomy. What has been missing from this debate, however, is an understanding of how “non-experts” in AI ethically evaluate facial AI inference-making. In a two-scenario vignette study with 24 treatment groups, we show that non-experts (N = 3745) reject facial AI inferences such as trustworthiness and likability from portrait images in a low-stake advertising and a high-stake hiring context. In contrast, non-experts agree with facial AI inferences such as skin color or gender in the advertising but not the hiring decision context. For each AI inference, we ask non-experts to justify their evaluation in a written response. Analyzing 29,760 written justifications, we find that non-experts are either “evidentialists” or “pragmatists”: they assess the ethical status of a facial AI inference based on whether they think faces warrant sufficient or insufficient evidence for an inference (evidentialist justification) or whether making the inference results in beneficial or detrimental outcomes (pragmatist justification). Non-experts’ justifications underscore the normative complexity behind facial AI inference-making. AI inferences with insufficient evidence can be rationalized by considerations of relevance while irrelevant inferences can be justified by reference to sufficient evidence. We argue that participatory approaches contribute valuable insights for the development of ethical AI in an increasingly visual data culture.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3531146.3533080,3,,,,,,,Severin Engelmann and Chiara Ullstein and Orestis Papakyriakopoulos and Jens Grossklags,10.1145/3531146.3533080,,,,"artificial intelligence,computer vision,human faces,participatory AI ethics",,,128-141,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3531146.3533080,2022,"New York, NY, USA",

This reduced participation of women, very low in disciplines related with technology motivates the hegemonic presence of androcentric and sexist values both in knowledge and in the products and information technologies that we can find in the market.In highly masculinized disciplines the inclusion of the gender perspective is important whenever the content, the results or the applications of a subject may affect human beings directly or indirectly. Specially, in disciplines related with technology where it is very common for men and women to be affected differently by technological developments. This paper focus in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, where the majority of professionals are men and their experiences shape and dominate algorithm creation. To recognize the existence of gender discriminatory biases in the algorithms and limit their consequences in the offline world, we need to introduce the gender perspective in these studies.

As artificial intelligence solutions take on increasingly important roles in decision-making and interaction, they have the potential to impact fair treatment of people with disabilities in society both positively and negatively. We describe some of the opportunities and risks across four emerging AI application areas: employment, education, public safety, and healthcare, identified in a workshop with participants experiencing a range of disabilities. In many existing situations, non-AI solutions are already discriminatory, and introducing AI runs the risk of simply perpetuating and replicating these flaws. We next discuss strategies for supporting fairness in the context of disability throughout the AI development lifecycle. AI systems should be reviewed for potential impact on the user in their broader context of use. They should offer opportunities to redress errors, and for users and those impacted to raise fairness concerns. People with disabilities should be included when sourcing data to build models, and in testing, to create a more inclusive and robust system. Finally, we offer pointers into an established body of literature on human-centered design processes and philosophies that may assist AI and ML engineers in innovating algorithms that reduce harm and ultimately enhance the lives of people with disabilities.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3362077.3362086,3,,,,,,,Shari Trewin and Sara Basson and Michael Muller and Stacy Branham and Jutta Treviranus and Daniel Gruen and Daniel Hebert and Natalia Lyckowski and Erich Manser,10.1145/3362077.3362086,,3,AI Matters,,12,,40-63,,Association for Computing Machinery,5,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3362077.3362086,2019,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1461,inproceedings,Efficient Spatial Temporal Convolutional Features for Audiovisual Continuous Affect Recognition,"Affective dimension prediction from multi-modal is becoming an increasingly attractive research field in artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) . Previous works have shown that discriminative features from multiple modalities are of importance to accurately recognize emotional states. Recently, deep representations have proved to be effective for emotional state recognition. To investigate new deep spatial-temporal features and evaluate their effectiveness for affective dimension recognition, in this paper, we propose:~(1) combining a pre-trained 2D-CNN and a 1D-CNN for learning deep spatial-temporal features from video images and audio spectrograms; and~(2) a spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN) adapted to facial landmarks graph. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed spatial-temporal features for affective dimension prediction, we propose Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (DBLSTM) model for single-modality prediction, early-fusion and late-fusion predictions. With respect to the liking dimension, we use the text modality for prediction. Experimental results, on the AVEC2019 CES dataset, show that our proposed spatial-temporal features and recognition model obtain promising results. On the development set, the obtained concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) is up to 0.724 for arousal and 0.705 for valence, and on the test set, the CCC is 0.513 for arousal and 0.515 for valence, which outperform the baseline system with corresponding CCC of 0.355 and 0.468 on arousal and valence, respectively.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3347320.3357690,3,,,,,,,Haifeng Chen and Yifan Deng and Shiwen Cheng and Yixuan Wang and Dongmei Jiang and Hichem Sahli,10.1145/3347320.3357690,,,,"affective dimension,deep spatial-temporal feature,emotion,multimodal",,,19-26,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3347320.3357690,2019,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1462,inproceedings,SGSF: a small groups based serial fusion method,"With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Internet of things (IoT), information fusion becomes one of the key technology. Serial fusion plays an important role in information fusion, which concatenates the features obtained from different sources to get a super-feature with higher discrimination. However, the performance of the serial fusion is usually affected by the poor quality of the indistinguishable real-world datasets, especially the problem of noise and imbalance. The existing noise data removal methods may destroy the data distribution, and the existing over-sampling methods may create noise samples. They may affect the result of feature reduction and further reduce the performance of the classification. To address these big practical challenges, a novel Small-Groups-based Serial Fusion method (SGSF) is proposed. SGSF consists of two main parts: a Small-Groups-based Noise Removal method (SGNR) and a small-groups-based Positive Region Oriented Oversampling method (PROO). Both of these two methods are based on the Neighborhood Rough Set (NRS) theory. SGNR identifies and removes low-density noise samples whilst keeps the high-density outlier samples, targeting to enlarge the limited NRS positive region and preserve the data distribution. PROO generates new samples towards the NRS positive region so that it can balance the dataset and increase the number of samples with more explicit features. Intensive experiments are carried out to verify the performance of SGSF based on 3 publicly available datasets and 6 self-collected medical datasets. The results demonstrate that SGSF increases the classification accuracy from existing 82.2% to 94.3%.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3302506.3310392,3,,,,,,,Nian Wang and Zhe Zhang and Tingting Li and Jing Xiao and Li Cui,10.1145/3302506.3310392,,,,"exclave groups,neighborhood rough set small group,noise removal,positive region oriented oversampling,serial fusion",,,97-108,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3302506.3310392,2019,"New York, NY, USA",

To do this, we will 1) elaborate on our conceptual model and the ageist technology-mediated cycles of injustice that can produce and reinforce digital ageism; 2) present empirical evidence of our descriptive analysis of seven commonly used facial image datasets to highlight data disparities for older adults which will provide real-world evidence that substantiates one of the elements in our ageist cycles of injustice; and 3) summarize results from our grey literature search of various grey literature databases including the AI ethics guidelines Global Inventory to identify guidance documents that address ageism in AI in research or technology development. This paper uniquely contributes conceptual and empirical evidence of digital ageism which will advance knowledge in the field and deepen our understanding of how ageism in AI is fostered by broader ageist cycles of injustice.

ID-1464,inproceedings,Is AI-generated content better? A study based on Ant Forest Game content recommendation,"As we entered the 21st century, with the development of computers and mobile internet, research in Artificial Intelligence has made significant advancements. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of science and engineering focused on enabling computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It encompasses various subfields such as machine learning, expert systems, natural language processing, and computer vision. In 2022, OpenAI released a new chatbot model named ChatGPT, which can understand human language and generate text like a human. Its robust data capabilities have attracted the attention of experts in various fields. However, the public's perception and attitude towards AI technology and ChatGPT are also crucial. Therefore, in this study, we used an online experiment and employed different groups of ChatGPT-generated content recommendation and real-person-generated content recommendation as experimental manipulation conditions. From the user perception perspective, we aimed to explore the differences between user perceptions of content recommendation provided by Artificial Intelligence (ChatGPT) and those provided by real-person. We also investigated whether the perception of AI-generated (ChatGPT) content recommendation had an impact on users' subsequent intention to support Ant Forest Game. The results show significant differences in perceived content quality between AI-generated (ChatGPT) Ant Forest Game content recommendation and real-person-generated content recommendation. Additionally, in terms of subsequent support intention for Ant Forest Game, there were also significant differences between AI-generated (ChatGPT) Ant Forest Game content recommendation and real-person generated Ant Forest Game content recommendation. Ant Forest Game content recommendation was found to significantly enhance Ant Forest Game support intention. Participants exhibited higher perceived content quality and greater support intention for AI-generated (ChatGPT) Ant Forest Game content recommendation. This study explores the psychological mechanisms involved in human-computer interaction, contributing to research in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Compared to a real human person's recommendation, people tend to prefer ChatGPT's recommendation, showing that people exhibit similar social behaviors and emotional responses when interacting with generative AI (ChatGPT) as they do with real humans.

Interactive learning platforms have become mainstream in the context of the big data era. This article takes an online course in a university as an example to explore user interest points, demand characteristics and knowledge acquisition rules in an artificial intelligence system environment. After processing and analyzing students' browsing behavior in different scenarios, the corresponding results are returned to the database to better grasp the user's preference information and provide more services for teaching. At the same time, through the application of machine intelligence algorithms and AI technology, the personalized recommendation capabilities of the learning platform can be improved to meet students' personalized learning needs. This article tests the algorithm of the system. The test results show that the content-based recommendation algorithm performs medium to high in accuracy, but its coverage is low and is not affected by data sparsity. The collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm performs generally highest in terms of accuracy and coverage, with an accuracy rate of 96%, and is sensitive to sparse data. The hybrid recommendation algorithm has high accuracy and coverage, and factors such as data sparsity have a medium to high impact on it. Recommendation algorithms based on deep learning show high levels of accuracy and coverage, and their impact on factors such as data sparsity is also moderate to high. However, although artificial intelligence technology has broad prospects for application in the field of education, it also faces some challenges, such as privacy protection and compliance with data use.

ID-1472,inproceedings,Nonverbal Human Signals Can Help Autonomous Agents Infer Human Preferences for Their Behavior,"An overarching goal of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is creating autonomous, social agents that help people. Two important challenges, though, are that different people prefer different assistance from agents and that preferences can change over time. Thus, helping behaviors should be tailored to how an individual feels during the interaction. We hypothesize that human nonverbal behavior can give clues about users' preferences for an agent's helping behaviors, augmenting an agent's ability to computationally predict such preferences with machine learning models. To investigate our hypothesis, we collected data from 194 participants via an online survey in which participants were recorded while playing a multiplayer game. We evaluated whether the inclusion of nonverbal human signals, as well as additional context (e.g., via game or personality information), led to improved prediction of user preferences between agent behaviors compared to explicitly provided survey responses. Our results suggest that nonverbal communication – a common type of human implicit feedback – can aid in understanding how people want computational agents to interact with them.",https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10474196,1,1,1,,,,how can AI leverage human nonverbal behaviors to improve reception by users?,Kate Candon and Jesse Chen and Yoony Kim and Zoe Hsu and Nathan Tsoi and Marynel Vázquez,,,,,"human-agent interaction,nonverbal behavior,preference learning",,,307-316,,International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,,,2023,"Richland, SC",
ID-1473,article,AI-Enabled Smart Glasses for People with Severe Vision Impairments,"Over the last decade, there has been significant research on how smart assistive devices with artificial intelligence (AI) built into them can assist people with severe vision impairments to comprehend their surroundings. These devices come in various forms such as smartphone applications, smart-glasses, and smart canes. Smart glasses have gained popularity lately due to recent technological advancements, as well as their natural position in front of the user's eyes. However, there has been limited research to understand how people with severe vision impairments would prefer to interact with them. The objective of this project is to investigate the use of AI-enabled smart-glasses to aid individuals with severe vision impairments. The research aims to comprehend the differences between the types of research conducted by researchers and the needs and desires of the community. The study will utilise a Design Thinking approach and involve vision-impaired users throughout the project by utilising co-design methods. The research will involve the development of smart-glass application prototypes through iterative case studies with individuals who are blind, have low-vision, and have cerebral vision impairment (CVI). The goal is to understand the users' preferred interaction model from their lived experiences. The outcome of the research will also be a software architecture that enables people with severe vision impairments to seamlessly access information about their surroundings.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3654768.3654771,3,,,,,,,Bhanuka Gamage,10.1145/3654768.3654771,1558-2337,137,SIGACCESS Access.

ID-1474,inproceedings,How Does Predictive Information Affect Human Ethical Preferences?,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly involved in decision making in high-stakes domains, including loan applications, employment screening, and assistive clinical decision making. Meanwhile, involving AI in these high-stake decisions has created ethical concerns on how to balance different trade-offs to respect human values. One approach for aligning AIs with human values is to elicit human ethical preferences and incorporate this information in the design of computer systems. In this work, we explore how human ethical preferences are impacted by the information shown to humans during elicitation. In particular, we aim to provide a contrast between verifiable information (e.g., patient demographics or blood test results) and predictive information (e.g., the probability of organ transplant success). Using kidney transplant allocation as a case study, we conduct a randomized experiment to elicit human ethical preferences on scarce resource allocation to understand how human ethical preferences are impacted by the verifiable and predictive information. We find that the presence of predictive information significantly changes how humans take into account other verifiable information in their ethical preferences. We also find that the source of the predictive information (e.g., whether the predictions are made by AI or human doctors) plays a key role in how humans incorporate the predictive information into their own ethical judgements.",https://dl-acm-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3514094.3534165,1,1,1,"medical, healthcare",,,RQ2 is relevant because it manipulates prediction source (AI or human),Saumik Narayanan and Guanghui Yu and Wei Tang and Chien-Ju Ho and Ming Yin,10.1145/3514094.3534165,,,,"ai ethics,ethical preference,preference elicitation",,,508-517,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3514094.3534165,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1475,inproceedings,A New Creative Generation Pipeline for Click-Through Rate with Stable Diffusion Model,"In online advertising scenario, sellers often create multiple creatives to provide comprehensive demonstrations, making it essential to present the most appealing design to maximize the Click-Through Rate (CTR). However, sellers generally struggle to consider users' preferences for creative design, leading to the relatively lower aesthetics and quantities compared to Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches. Traditional AI-based approaches still face the same problem of not considering user information while having limited aesthetic knowledge from designers. In fact that fusing the user information, the generated creatives can be more attractive because different users may have different preferences. To optimize the results, the generated creatives in traditional methods are then ranked by another module named creative ranking model. The ranking model can predict the CTR score for each creative considering user features. However, the two above stages (generating creatives and ranking creatives) are regarded as two different tasks and are optimized separately. Specifically, generating creatives in the first stage without considering the target of improving CTR task may generate several creatives with poor quality, leading to dilute online impressions and directly making bad effectiveness on online results.In this paper, we proposed a new automated C reative G eneration pipeline for Click-Through Rate (CG4CTR).1 The code is at with the goal of improving CTR during the creative generation stage. In this pipeline, a new creative is automatically generated and selected by stable diffusion method with the LoRA model and two novel models: prompt model and reward model. Our contributions have four parts: 1) The inpainting mode in stable diffusion method is firstly applied to creative image generation task in online advertising scene. A self-cyclic generation pipeline is proposed to ensure the convergence of training. 2) Prompt model is designed to generate individualized creative images for different user groups, which can further improve the diversity and quality of the generated creatives. 3) Reward model comprehensively considers the multi-modal features of image and text to improve the effectiveness of creative ranking task, and it is also critical in self-cyclic generation pipeline. 4) The significant benefits obtained in online and offline experiments verify the significance of our proposed method.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3589335.3648315,3,,,,,,,Hao Yang and Jianxin Yuan and Shuai Yang and Linhe Xu and Shuo Yuan and Yifan Zeng,10.1145/3589335.3648315,,,,"creative generation,prompt and reward models,stable diffusion",,,180-189,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3589335.3648315,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1476,inproceedings,Warmth and Competence in Human-Agent Cooperation,"Interaction and cooperation with humans are overarching aspirations of artificial intelligence (AI) research. Recent studies demonstrate that AI agents trained with deep reinforcement learning are capable of collaborating with humans. These studies primarily evaluate human compatibility through ""objective"" metrics such as task performance, obscuring potential variation in the levels of trust and subjective preference that different agents garner. To better understand the factors shaping subjective preferences in human-agent cooperation, we train deep reinforcement learning agents in Coins, a two-player social dilemma. We recruit participants for a human-agent cooperation study and measure their impressions of the agents they encounter. Participants' perceptions of warmth and competence predict their stated preferences for different agents, above and beyond objective performance metrics. Drawing inspiration from social science and biology research, we subsequently implement a new ""partner choice"" framework to elicit revealed preferences: after playing an episode with an agent, participants are asked whether they would like to play the next round with the same agent or to play alone. As with stated preferences, social perception better predicts participants' revealed preferences than does objective performance. Given these results, we recommend human-agent interaction researchers routinely incorporate the measurement of social perception and subjective preferences into their studies.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10458-024-09649-6,3,,,,,,,Kevin R McKee and Xuechunzi Bai and Susan T Fiske,,,,,"competence,human-agent cooperation,human-agent interaction,partner choice,preferences,social perception,warmth",,,898-907,,International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,,,2022,"Richland, SC",

Very often, AI-based apps are personalized and modelled on users’ needs and preferences. However, such applications of AI tread a delicate balance between enhancing user experience and jeopardizing personal autonomy. Personal autonomy and sense of agency are crucial for human well-being and development. In this paper, we probe this fine balance aiming to capture users’ lived experiences and perceptions of interacting with AI-based apps. We present insights from a phenomenological study (N=15) regarding users’ perception of personal autonomy when interacting with AI in everyday contexts. We found that these experiences are transitory and largely influenced by contextual factors. Users experience a loss of autonomy when their privacy or identity is threatened or when their expectations are broken. To mitigate such loss of autonomy, mechanisms for providing intelligibility and control of AI are desired.",https://dl-acm-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3450613.3456820,1,2,2,,,,,Supraja Sankaran and Panos Markopoulos,10.1145/3450613.3456820,,,,"autonomy,human-AI interaction,phenomenology,user experience",,,108-118,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3450613.3456820,2021,"New York, NY, USA",

Consequently, the generation of multimodal summaries is of tremendous interest for broadcasters and fans alike, as a large percentage of audiences prefer to follow only the main highlights of a game. However, annotating important events and producing summaries often requires expensive equipment and a lot of tedious, cumbersome, manual labour. In this context, recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown great potential. The goal of this work is to create an automated soccer game summarization pipeline using AI. In particular, our focus is on the generation of complete game summaries in continuous text format with length constraints, based on raw game multimedia, as well as readily available game metadata and captions where applicable, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools along with heuristics. We curate and extend a number of soccer datasets, implement an end-to-end pipeline for the automatic generation of text summaries, present our preliminary results from the comparative analysis of various summarization methods within this pipeline using different input modalities, and provide a discussion of open challenges in the field of automated game summarization.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3552463.3557019,3,,,,,,,Sushant Gautam and Cise Midoglu and Saeed Shafiee Sabet and Dinesh Baniya Kshatri and Pal Halvorsen,10.1145/3552463.3557019,,,,"ai,automated pipeline,football,nlp,soccer game summary",,,13-22,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3552463.3557019,2022,"New York, NY, USA",

However, most existing apps are not grounded in social comparison theories and do not consider individual differences in social comparison preferences and reactions. This paper is among the first to automatically personalize social comparison targets. In the context of an m-health app for physical activity, we use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques of multi-armed bandits. Results from our user study (n=53) indicate that there is some evidence that motivation can be increased using the AI-based personalization of social comparison. The detected effects achieved small-to-moderate effect sizes, illustrating the real-world implications of the intervention for enhancing motivation and physical activity. In addition to design implications for social comparison features in social apps, this paper identified the personalization paradox, the conflict between user modeling and adaptation, as a key design challenge of personalized applications for behavior change.

ID-1481,article,Towards Tangible Algorithms: Exploring the Experiences of Tangible Interactions with Movie Recommender Algorithms,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) supports many of our everyday activities and decisions. However, personalized algorithmic recommendations often produce adverse experiences due to a lack of awareness, control, or transparency. While research has directed solutions on graphical user interfaces (GUIs), there are no explorations of Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) to improve the experience with such systems, despite the valid existing academic arguments in favor of this exploration. Therefore, centering on transparency and control, we analyzed how 18 users of movie recommender systems perceived four different TUIs using individual co-design sessions and post-interview questionnaires. Through thematic analysis, we identified seven design considerations while designing TUIs to interact with algorithmic movie recommender systems: (1) Distinctions between TUIs and GUIs; (2) TUIs replacing predominant interfaces; (3) Preference for single-device TUIs; (4) The relevance of granular control for TUIs; (5) Apparent transparency limitations of TUIs; (6) TUIs and algorithmic social computing; and (7) Overview of specific design choices, including advantages and disadvantages of soft, hard, rounded, cubic, and humanoid interfaces. These findings inspired Recffy: the first functional TUI designed to enhance awareness and control in personalized movie recommendations. Based on this study, we propose the concept of Tangible Algorithms: TUIs dedicated to enhancing the interaction of algorithmic systems and their profiling processes or decisions in a specific context. Furthermore, we describe the relevance of tangible algorithms and design guidelines to promote them in diverse AI contexts.

ID-1482,inproceedings,Subgoal-Based Explanations for Unreliable Intelligent Decision Support Systems,"Intelligent decision support (IDS) systems leverage artificial intelligence techniques to generate recommendations that guide human users through the decision making phases of a task. However, a key challenge is that IDS systems are not perfect, and in complex real-world scenarios may produce suboptimal output or fail to work altogether. The field of explainable AI (XAI) has sought to develop techniques that improve the interpretability of black-box systems. While most XAI work has focused on single-classification tasks, the subfield of explainable AI planning (XAIP) has sought to develop techniques that make sequential decision making AI systems explainable to domain experts. Critically, prior work in applying XAIP techniques to IDS systems has assumed that the plan being proposed by the planner is always optimal, and therefore the action or plan being recommended as decision support to the user is always optimal. In this work, we examine novice user interactions with a non-robust IDS system – one that occasionally recommends suboptimal actions, and one that may become unavailable after users have become accustomed to its guidance. We introduce a new explanation type, subgoal-based explanations, for plan-based IDS systems, that supplements traditional IDS output with information about the subgoal toward which the recommended action would contribute. We demonstrate that subgoal-based explanations lead to improved user task performance in the presence of IDS recommendations, improve user ability to distinguish optimal and suboptimal IDS recommendations, and are preferred by users. Additionally, we demonstrate that subgoal-based explanations enable more robust user performance in the case of IDS failure, showing the significant benefit of training users for an underlying task with subgoal-based explanations.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3581641.3584055,3,,,,,,,Devleena Das and Been Kim and Sonia Chernova,10.1145/3581641.3584055,,,,"Explainable AI,Intelligent Decision Support Systems,Planning",,,240-250,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3581641.3584055,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1488,inproceedings,Overcoming challenges for achieving high in-situ training accuracy with emerging memories,"Embedded artificial intelligence (AI) prefers the adaptive learning capability when deployed in the field, thus in-situ training on-chip is required. Emerging non-volatile memories (eNVMs) are of great interests serving as analog synapses in deep neural network (DNN) on-chip acceleration due to its multilevel programmability. However, the asymmetry/nonlinearity in the conductance tuning remains a grand challenge for achieving high in-situ training accuracy. In addition, analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at the edge of the memory array introduces an additional challenge - quantization error for in-memory computing. In this work, we gain new insights and overcome these challenges through an algorithm-hardware co-optimization. We incorporate these hardware non-ideal effects into the DNN propagation and weight update steps. We evaluate on a VGG-like network for CIFAR-10 dataset, and we show that the asymmetry of the conductance tuning is no longer a limiting factor of in-situ training accuracy if exploiting adaptive ""momentum"" in the weight update rule. Even considering ADC quantization error, in-situ training accuracy could approach software baseline.

ID-1491,inproceedings,Modeling Epistemological Principles for Bias Mitigation in AI Systems: An Illustration in Hiring Decisions,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used extensively in automatic decision making in a broad variety of scenarios, ranging from credit ratings for loans to recommendations of movies. Traditional design guidelines for AI models focus essentially on accuracy maximization, but recent work has shown that economically irrational and socially unacceptable scenarios of discrimination and unfairness are likely to arise unless these issues are explicitly addressed. This undesirable behavior has several possible sources, such as biased datasets used for training that may not be detected in black-box models. After pointing out connections between such bias of AI and the problem of induction, we focus on Popper's contributions after Hume's, which offer a logical theory of preferences. An AI model can be preferred over others on purely rational grounds after one or more attempts at refutation based on accuracy and fairness. Inspired by such epistemological principles, this paper proposes a structured approach to mitigate discrimination and unfairness caused by bias in AI systems. In the proposed computational framework, models are selected and enhanced after attempts at refutation.

We argue for an evaluation which is held to the same standards as a human agent, removing the demand that ethical behaviour is always achieved. We introduce four key meta-qualities desired for our moral standards, and then proceed to clarify how we can prove that an agent will correctly learn to perform moral actions given a set of samples within certain error bounds. Our group-dynamic approach enables us to demonstrate that the learned models converge to a common function to achieve stability. We further explain a valuable intrinsic consistency check made possible through the derivation of logical statements from the machine learning model. In all, this work proposes an approach for building ethical AI systems, coming from the perspective of artificial intelligence research, and sheds important light on understanding how much learning is required in order for an intelligent agent to behave morally with negligible error.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3278721.3278728,3,,,,,,,Nolan P Shaw and Andreas Stöckel and Ryan W Orr and Thomas F Lidbetter and Robin Cohen,10.1145/3278721.3278728,,,,"multi-agent systems,provably moral ai,statistical machine learning",,,271-277,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3278721.3278728,2018,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1493,inproceedings,Activity Ontologies for Intelligent Calendar Applications,"Intelligent Calendar Applications (ICA) have recently emerged as a very promising target field for Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, since calendar applications are used daily by millions of people world-wide. ICAs built on traditional electronic calendars, by empowering them with efficient scheduling engines, being able to schedule and reschedule a user's events within its calendar. However, in order to fully exploit the dynamics of an ICA, the user has to describe his events with much more detail than with a traditional electronic calendar, in order for the scheduler to have all the necessary information, that is, attribute values, constraints and preferences, to schedule the events.Existing XML based formats to describe events, such as iCalendar, do not provide enough context for the information needed in order to describe a rich event, to be used by an ICA. In this paper we present three ontologies that have been designed to be used by modern ICAs, in order to exchange information about events between ICAs and event providers. The ontologies have been designed in order to describe the event, its temporal aspects, as well as the user's constraints and preferences.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/2801081.2801109,3,,,,,,,Agnantis Konstantinos and Refanidis Ioannis,10.1145/2801081.2801109,,,,"Activities,Events,Intelligent Calendars,Modeling,Ontology,Semantic Web",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/2801081.2801109,2015,"New York, NY, USA",

We examine existing approaches to land valuation used in the UK, notably Trade Area Analysis, Spatial Interaction and Comparable Sales. We make the case that land use analysis, demographics and societal preferences affect the potential income and optimal use of parcels of land and hence the value of those parcels. This hypothesis leads to the introduction of a number of additional factors required to facilitate estimated land value, including traffic flow, population and site suitability. A number of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning spatial-temporal techniques are introduced to predict the value of all land parcels sold since 1995. We introduce a new technique, which includes (i) the application of Support Vector Machines to land use analysis; (ii) the use of predictive techniques for macro-environmental factors; (iii) the use of large, open-source data sets to improve valuation; (iv) industry alignment in predefined industrial tool.

ID-1502,inproceedings,A Robot Walks into a Bar: Can Language Models Serve as Creativity SupportTools for Comedy? An Evaluation of LLMs’ Humour Alignment with Comedians,"We interviewed twenty professional comedians who perform live shows in front of audiences and who use artificial intelligence in their artistic process as part of 3-hour workshops on “AI x Comedy” conducted at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2023 and online. The workshop consisted of a comedy writing session with large language models (LLMs), a human-computer interaction questionnaire to assess the Creativity Support Index of AI as a writing tool, and a focus group interrogating the comedians’ motivations for and processes of using AI, as well as their ethical concerns about bias, censorship and copyright. Participants noted that existing moderation strategies used in safety filtering and instruction-tuned LLMs reinforced hegemonic viewpoints by erasing minority groups and their perspectives, and qualified this as a form of censorship. At the same time, most participants felt the LLMs did not succeed as a creativity support tool, by producing bland and biased comedy tropes, akin to “cruise ship comedy material from the 1950s, but a bit less racist”. Our work extends scholarship about the subtle difference between, one the one hand, harmful speech, and on the other hand, “offensive” language as a practice of resistance, satire and “punching up”.

Research focuses on investigating benefits and challenges of AI agents that make decisions without human-intervention, namely AI-systems that independently exercise administrative discretion. However, little is known about citizens’ perspective of such autonomous systems. To address this gap, we investigated citizens’ fairness and satisfaction perceptions of an AI-based self-service kiosk that performs administrative discretion. Through a controlled Wizard of Oz experiment, we assessed how citizens perceived the kiosk’s decision to either impose or waive a fine. Precisely, we measured how engaging citizens in the decision-making process through a dialogue affect their perceptions. We contribute novel citizen-oriented views on how to apply AI-based discretion in public administration. Our results revealed that while citizens do not generally oppose delegating discretionary power to fully autonomous systems, engaging them in the decision-making process through a dialogue will positively alter their perceptions.

ID-1505,article,Discovering Expert-Level Air Combat Knowledge via Deep Excitatory-Inhibitory Factorized Reinforcement Learning,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a wide range of successes in autonomous air combat decision-making recently. Previous research demonstrated that AI-enabled air combat approaches could even acquire beyond human-level capabilities. However, there remains a lack of evidence regarding two major difficulties. First, the existing methods with fixed decision intervals are mostly devoted to solving what to act but merely pay attention to when to act, which occasionally misses optimal decision opportunities. Second, the method of an expert-crafted finite maneuver library leads to a lack of tactics diversity, which is vulnerable to an opponent equipped with new tactics. In view of this, we propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and prior knowledge hybrid autonomous air combat tactics discovering algorithm, namely deep Excitatory-iNhibitory fACTorIzed maneuVEr (ENACTIVE) learning. The algorithm consists of two key modules, i.e., ENHANCE and FACTIVE. Specifically, ENHANCE learns to adjust the air combat decision-making intervals and appropriately seize key opportunities. FACTIVE factorizes maneuvers and then jointly optimizes them with significant tactics diversity increments. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms with a 62% winning rate and further obtains a margin of a 2.85-fold increase in terms of global tactic space coverage.

It is common for digital versions of board games, as any other type of digital games, to offer the option to select the difficulty of the game.

ID-1509,inproceedings,A Smart and Private Blockchain-enabled Framework for Digital Assets,"Nowadays, many digital assets are generated all the time, and managing these digital assets has become an important issue. The traditional digital asset management system manages data by the service provider, and data is not processed transparently. Furthermore, centralized storage makes Single Point of Failure (SPOF), and it is also challenging to ensure that data backed up by all nodes are synchronized. Rapid improvement of blockchain technology, the above two problems are resolved by leveraging blockchain’s decentralization and tamper resistance characteristics. The EU General Data Protection Rules (GDPR) state the principles for protecting data owners in 2018. Several principles for deleting personal data conflict with the blockchain, such as Storage Limit and the Right to Be Forgotten. The existing blockchain-enabled digital asset management methods do not apply to the GDPR. Although some methods are proposed for storing digital assets in off-chain storage and storing the hash address of storage in the blockchain, the problem of SPOF has not been resolved yet. This motivates to propose SPChain, a smarter and private GDPR-compliant digital asset framework enabled by blockchain and decentralized InterPlanetary File System is implemented to solve the problem of SPOF. The proposed SPChain to digital art management provides an implementation using Hyperledger Fabric. The proposed framework consists of a model developer, art creator, collector, service provider and securely assessed AI model for managing digital assets. The experiments measured throughput, latency and resource consumption of various functions in the smart contract’s artwork_CC, walle_CC, 3A_CC, log_CC, model_CC.

ID-1510,article,HLS-based High-throughput and Work-efficient Synthesizable Graph Processing Template Pipeline,"Hardware systems composed of diverse execution resources are being deployed to cope with the complexity and performance requirements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications. With the emergence of new hardware platforms, system-wide programming support has become much more important. While this is true for various devices ranging from CPUs to GPUs, it is especially critical for specific neural network accelerators implemented on FPGAs. For example, Intel’s recent HARP platform encompasses a Xeon CPU and an FPGA, which requires an intense software stack to be used effectively. Programming such a hybrid system will be a challenge for most of the non-expert users. High-level language solutions such as Intel OpenCL for FPGA try to address the problem. However, as the abstraction level increases, the efficiency of implementation decreases, depicting two opposing requirements. In this work, we propose a framework to generate HLS-based, FPGA-accelerated, high-throughput/work-efficient, synthesizable, and template-based graph-processing pipeline. While a fixed and clock-wise precisely designed deep-pipeline architecture, written in SystemC, is responsible for processing graph vertices, the user implements the intended iterative graph algorithm by implementing/modifying only a single module in C/C++. This way, efficiency and high performance can be achieved with better programmability and productivity. With similar programming efforts, it is shown that the proposed template outperforms a high-throughput OpenCL baseline by up to 50% in terms of edge throughput. Furthermore, the novel work-efficient design significantly improves execution time and power consumption by up to 100.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3529256,3,,,,,,,Hamzeh Ahangari and Muhammet Mustafa Özdal and Özcan Öztürk,10.1145/3529256,1539-9087,2,ACM Trans.

ID-1511,article,Investigation of the Effect of “Fog of War” in the Prediction of StarCraft Strategy Using Machine Learning,"StarCraft is a well-known real-time strategy game developed by Blizzard Entertainment in 1998. One of the characteristics of this game is “fog of war,” which refers to the fact that players cannot see their opponents' regions but only their own unit. This characteristic of the game means that the information required in order to predicting the opponent's strategy is only available through “scouting.” Although the “fog of war” is one of the most important features of the game, it has not been deeply understood in the design of artificial intelligence. In this work, we propose to investigate the effect of the “fog of war” in the prediction of opponent's strategy using machine learning for human players and artificial intelligence (AI) bots. To realize this analysis, we develop a customized replay analyzer that exports the internal game events with/without the fog of war. In the experimental results, we collect replays from various sources: human vs. human, human vs. AI bots, and AI bots vs. AI bots. This systematic analysis with “fog of war” reveals the predictability of the machine-learning algorithms on different conditions and the directions for designing new artificial intelligence for the game.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/2735384,3,,,,,,,Hochul Cho and Hyunsoo Park and Chang-Yeun Kim and Kyung-Joong Kim,10.1145/2735384,,1,Comput.

ID-1512,inproceedings,Reinforced Evolutionary Algorithms for Game Difficulty Control,"In the field of game designing, artificial intelligence is used to generate responsive, adaptive, or intelligent behaviors primarily in Non-Player-Characters (NPCs). There is a large demand for controlling game AI since a variety of players expect to be provided NPC opponents with appropriate difficulties to improve their game experience. However, to the best of our knowledge, a few works are focusing on this problem. In this paper, we firstly present a Reinforced Evolutionary Algorithm based on the Difficulty-Difference objective (REA-DD) to the DLAI problem, which combines reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms. REA-DD is able to generate the desired difficulty level of game AI accurately. Nonetheless, REA can only obtain a kind of game AI in each run. To improve efficiency, another algorithm based on Multi-objective Optimization is proposed, regarded as RMOEA-DD, which obtains DLAI after one run. Experiments on the game Pong from ALE and apply on a commercial game named The Ghost Story to show that our algorithms provide valid methods to the DLAI problem both in the term of controlling accuracy and efficiency.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3446132.3446165,3,,,,,,,Guangwu Cui and Ruimin Shen and Yingfeng Chen and Juan Zou and Shengxiang Yang and Changjie Fan and Jinghua Zheng,10.1145/3446132.3446165,,,,"Difficulty levels,Evolutionary algorithms,Game AI,Reinforcement learning",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3446132.3446165,2021,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1513,inproceedings,Reinforcement Learning based Strategy Selection in StarCraft: Brood War,"Artificial intelligence (AI) applied on real-time strategy (RTS) games, such as StarCraft has become a hot topic in recent years. Currently, many researches mainly focused on the aspects of applying reinforcement learning (RL) on the aspects, such as the building order, map analysis, macro- and micro-management, etc. This paper innovatively proposes a mechanism applying reinforcement learning on pre-designed game strategies, which can be considered as human experience and combinations of both the macro- and micro-management. In our work, game strategies are formed by many sub-strategy modules that consist a series of orderly actions corresponding to certain components and game stages. Further, by applying RL on the strategy modules, the proposed mechanism can effectively improve selection of the game strategies, and balance the AI decision and human experience. Our bot was tested against some bots selected from AIIDE 2017-2018. The results show that with the RL framework, our bot can improve the overall winning rate from 42.79% to 59.36%.

ID-1517,inproceedings,Training low bitwidth convolutional neural network on RRAM,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved excellent performance on various artificial intelligence (AI) applications, while a higher demand on energy efficiency is required for future AI. Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM)-based computing system provides a promising solution to energy-efficient neural network training. However, it's difficult to support high-precision CNN in RRAM-based hardware systems. Firstly, multi-bit digital-analog interfaces will take up most energy overhead of the whole system. Secondly, it's difficult to write the RRAM to expected resistance states accurately; only low-precision numbers can be represented. To enable CNN training based on RRAM, we propose a low-bitwidth CNN training method, using low-bitwidth convolution outputs (CO), activations (A), weights (W) and gradients (G) to train CNN models based on RRAM. Furthermore, we design a system to implement the training algorithms. We explore the accuracy under different bitwidth combinations of (A,CO,W,G), and propose a practical tradeoff between accuracy and energy overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system perform well on low-bitwidth CNN training tasks. For example, training LeNet-5 with 4-bit convolution outputs, 4-bit weights, 4-bit activations and 4-bit gradients on MNIST can still achieve 97.67% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed system can achieve 23.0X higher energy efficiency than GPU when processing the training task of LeNet-5, and 4.4X higher energy efficiency when processing the training task of ResNet-20.",,3,,,,,,,Yi Cai and Tianqi Tang and Lixue Xia and Ming Cheng and Zhenhua Zhu and Yu Wang and Huazhong Yang,,,,,,,,117-122,,IEEE Press,,,2018,,

In this framework, we can deal with two perspectives of analyzing the concepts of naturalness and artificiality: (1) when we focus on intension perspective, the logical relations of natural- ness and artificiality by using the formal square of opposition with na\""\{\i\}ve set theory, the trivialization of the dichotomy of artificiality and naturalness in artificial intelligence will be made; (2) when we focus on extension perspective, with the concept of being natural in tandem with the concept of being artificial, we find that we need to elaborate the inherent inter- inclusive relationship between artificiality and naturalness, either by logical hexagon or by the SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation that we define, and a paradigm shift from GOFAI to emergentism AI occurs.

Sometimes when we play a game, we may wish that the computer opponents were written better. At those times while playing against the computer, we feel that the game is unbalanced. Perhaps the computer player has been given different set of rules, or uses the same rules, but has more resources (health, weapons, etc.). The complexity of underlying AI systems, along with game design, belies the resulting feeling we have when playing any game. As the CPU and GPU speed and power continues to grow, along with increasing memory amounts and bandwidth, game developers are constantly improving the graphics of their games. In the last five years the production quality of games has been increasing (along with the corresponding budgets). Recent games woo players with incredible breakthroughs in real- time 3D graphics, complexity of the worlds and characters, as well as various post-processing effects.

ID-1520,inproceedings,The effect of expression of anger and happiness in computer agents on negotiations with humans,"There is now considerable evidence in social psychology, economics, and related disciplines that emotion plays an important role in negotiation. For example, humans make greater concessions in negotiation to an opposing human who expresses anger, and they make fewer concessions to an opponent who expresses happiness, compared to a no-emotion-expression control. However, in AI, despite the wide interest in negotiation as a means to resolve differences between agents and humans, emotion has been largely ignored. This paper explores whether expression of anger or happiness by computer agents, in a multi-issue negotiation task, can produce effects that resemble effects seen in human-human negotiation. The paper presents an experiment where participants play with agents that express emotions (anger vs. happiness vs. control) through different modalities (text vs. facial displays). An important distinction in our experiment is that participants are aware that they negotiate with computer agents. The data indicate that the emotion effects observed in past work with humans also occur in agent-human negotiation, and occur independently of modality of expression. The implications of these results are discussed for the fields of automated negotiation, intelligent virtual agents and artificial intelligence.",,3,,,,,,,Celso M de Melo and Peter Carnevale and Jonathan Gratch,,,,,"agent,emotion,empirical,human,negotiation",,,937-944,,International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,,,2011,"Richland, SC",
ID-1521,article,A goal-oriented development tool to automate the incorporation of intelligent agents into interactive digital media applications,"Recent developments in games and interactive storytelling applications have seen artificially intelligent computer controlled characters being included extensively. Non-human controlled characters are starting to play an increasingly significant role in enhancing the perceived intelligence of games. Although many of them employed certain cheating techniques (e.g. allocating more resources at the start to AI opponents to make them appear more aggressive), some limited learning did appear in several games (e.g. letting AI opponents remember where human users initiated attacked in previous game). In our Virtual Singapura research project, we incorporate software agents into our virtual world to provide more complex user interactions. With intelligent software agents being infused into interactive digital media applications, there is great potential in improving the overall user experience. However, during the process of our research, we discovered that the traditional way of adding a multi-agent system into a computer game requires a large amount of investment in time and resources and a high level of expertise in Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE). Moreover, game AI is usually closely coupled with other parts of the game code which makes it hard to reuse or replace.

Over 9,800 images were generated using Craiyon and OpenAI's DALL-E 2 text-to-image models and evaluated on the three criteria proposed for determining the quality of visual AIGC: (1) the number of objects, (2), resolution (strictly image quality; label/prompt exclusive), and (3) representativeness (consideration for how well the image matches the label/prompt). We observe that the paid, DALL-E 2 model, produced a dataset with fewer objects per image, higher resolution, and higher representativeness compared to Craiyon (free).

Commercially, the current situation is that integrated AI such as Ameria [2], Uneeq [3], Neon [13], LaMDA [29] and the system using GPT-3 [9] have entered the market. However, there is no research that creates integrated AI with open source in the academic field. This work is an attempt to construct such an integrated AI as an academic research which is in an form of open source. Furthermore, this work is described in a form of multi-processing job with socket connection. Then, execution of the program can be accomplished by multiple computers. For the visual input, object detection is performed by Redman’s YOLO [14]. Next, the system accomplishes Image2text which generates sentences describing the image [34]. The system recognizes the meaning of visual input. As for speech recognition, the question and answering task is activated, and it is possible to give an accurate answer to the question through the microphone [7]. In addition, text generation enables this system to respond to human chattering [5]. This work combines four different sources: visual, text, audio, and scraping outworld news sources. We believe that attempts like this work will become more common in future AI studies.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3587716.3587760,3,,,,,,,Yoshiyuki Usami and Kosuke Kitaoka and Koichi Shindo,10.1145/3587716.3587760,,,,"mage2text,question and answering,text generation,visual object detection,visual object recognition",,,267-273,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3587716.3587760,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

Comparison of the Literature with a Focus Study,"Over the last decade there has been considerable research into how artificial intelligence (AI), specifically computer vision, can assist people who are blind or have low-vision (BLV) to understand their environment. However, there has been almost no research into whether the tasks (object detection, image captioning, text recognition etc.) and devices (smartphones, smart-glasses etc.) investigated by researchers align with the needs and preferences of BLV people. We identified 646 studies published in the last two and a half years that have investigated such assistive AI techniques. We analysed these papers to determine the task, device and participation by BLV individuals. We then interviewed 24 BLV people and asked for their top five AI-based applications and to rank the applications found in the literature.

ID-1533,inproceedings,Objective Portrait: A practice-based inquiry to explore Al as a reflective design partner,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being viewed as a creative partner rather than as a tool. How to design such collaborations is still a subject of speculation. In this pictorial, we propose a collaborative role for AI to prompt self-reflection. We explore this through a practice-based inquiry of whether and how AI could help a designer reflect on and relate to their own work. Three designers annotate a collection of images representing their fascinations, with subjective labels, indicating different dimensions of their visual concepts. These labels are used to teach an object detection model the designers’ perspectives. Then, they used this trained model on their own design work to evaluate the AI's potential to prompt self-reflection. By describing this process of AI-training we explore how an AI can help us become aware of our own implicit perspectives.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3563657.3595974,3,,,,,,,Vera van der Burg and Gijs de Boer and Alkim Almila Akdag Salah and Senthil Chandrasegaran and Peter Lloyd,10.1145/3563657.3595974,,,,,,,387-400,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3563657.3595974,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

In this paper we present our “opportunistic” interpretation, which advances the traditional DT concept and provides a valid support for enabling next-generation solutions in dynamic, distributed and large scale scenarios as smart cities. Indeed, by collecting simple data from the environment and by opportunistically elaborating them through AI techniques directly at the network edge (also referred to as Edge Intelligence), a digital version of a physical object can be built from the bottom up as well as dynamically manipulated and operated in a data-driven manner, thus enabling prompt responses to external stimuli and effective command actuation.

As a crucial part of irrigation scheduling, the monitoring object of precision irrigation will effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy in agricultural practice. This paper reviews the main monitoring objects used in irrigation scheduling in recent years. From the literature review, the monitoring objects are mainly divided into three categories based on soil moisture, weather and evapotranspiration, and plants, among which the monitoring based on soil moisture is the most common and direct method. At the same time, the development and application of Internet of Things(IoT), Wireless Sensor Network(WSN), Remote Sensing(RS) and Artificial Intelligence(AI) also provide advanced technical means for irrigation monitoring.

ID-1539,article,"Automated Backend Allocation for Multi-Model, On-Device AI Inference","On-Device Artificial Intelligence (AI) services such as face recognition, object tracking and voice recognition are rapidly scaling up deployments on embedded, memory-constrained hardware devices. These services typically delegate AI inference models for execution on CPU and GPU computing backends. While GPU delegation is a common practice to achieve high speed computation, the approach suffers from degraded throughput and completion times under multi-model scenarios, i.e. concurrently executing services. This paper introduces a solution to sustain performance in multi-model, on-device AI contexts by dynamically allocating a combination of CPU and GPU backends per model. The allocation is feedback-driven, and guided by a knowledge of model-specific, multi-objective pareto fronts comprising inference latency and memory consumption. Primary contribution of this paper is a backend allocation algorithm that runs online per model, and achieves 25-100% improvement in throughput over static allocations as well as load-balancing scheduler solutions targeting multi-model scenarios. Other noteworthy contributions include a novel pareto front estimator that runs on-device, and also a software-based GPU profiler with a lightweight algorithm to detect changing GPU workloads. Specifically, the pareto front estimator outperforms state of the art algorithms NSGA-II and SPEA2 by 94% on pareto coverage, and by almost 2x on computational overhead.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3626793,3,,,,,,,Venkatraman Iyer and Sungho Lee and Semun Lee and Juitem Joonwoo Kim and Hyunjun Kim and Youngjae Shin,10.1145/3626793,,3,Proc.

The model soup boosts the FROC score from 0.872 to 0.886, with no computational downsides. Next, two radiologists test their detection performance with and without the ensemble assistance on 20 CT studies.

To overcome these limitations, computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems using artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed, with transformer-based object detectors showing promising results. This study explores the rib fracture detection power of an out-of-the-box transformer detector and examines its adaptability to medical imaging. A private dataset of 30,000 chest radiographs was used to conduct experiments and compare the performance of transformer-based object detectors with a traditional CNN-based Faster-RCNN implementation. A retrospective analysis showed that transformer detectors had superior performance (i.e., 25.3mAP vs. 23.6mAP). Additionally, a reader study was conducted to evaluate the added diagnostic value of the AI system when assisting two radiologists in diagnosing chest x-rays. The results showed that the AI system provided valuable support improving the true positive rates from 73.6% to 83.4%.

ID-1542,inproceedings,MultiTest: Physical-Aware Object Insertion for Testing Multi-sensor Fusion Perception Systems,"Multi-sensor fusion stands as a pivotal technique in addressing numerous safety-critical tasks and applications, e.g., self-driving cars and automated robotic arms. With the continuous advancement in data-driven artificial intelligence (AI), MSF's potential for sensing and understanding intricate external environments has been further amplified, bringing a profound impact on intelligent systems and specifically on their perception systems. Similar to traditional software, adequate testing is also required for AI-enabled MSF systems. Yet, existing testing methods primarily concentrate on single-sensor perception systems (e.g., image-based and point cloud-based object detection systems). There remains a lack of emphasis on generating multi-modal test cases for MSF systems.To address these limitations, we design and implement MultiTest, a fitness-guided metamorphic testing method for complex MSF perception systems. MultiTest employs a physical-aware approach to synthesize realistic multi-modal object instances and insert them into critical positions of background images and point clouds. A fitness metric is designed to guide and boost the test generation process. We conduct extensive experiments with five SOTA perception systems to evaluate MultiTest from the perspectives of: (1) generated test cases' realism, (2) fault detection capabilities, and (3) performance improvement. The results show that MultiTest can generate realistic and modality-consistent test data and effectively detect hundreds of diverse faults of an MSF system under test. Moreover, retraining an MSF system on the test cases generated by MultiTest can improve the system's robustness.

ID-1546,article,A New Layer Structure of Cyber-Physical Systems under the Era of Digital Twin,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are new systems designed to support and synthesize sensing, communication, and computing components that interact with physical objects so that the system can sense, monitor, control, and respond to changes occurring in their operating environments. With developing Internet of Things (IoT), edge/cloud computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), another new paradigm - Digital Twin (DT), as an enabler for realizing the Metaverse of CPS has emerged recently. The DT provides a virtual replica of the physical world, allowing for real-time monitoring, control, and analysis of safety-critical systems like the CPS. Even though many CPS-related problems can be addressed using DT concepts, it is critical to define DT’s integration clearly to leverage its features to the best possible extent. This paper introduces a new layer called the data layer in the CPS layer architecture to support different DT functionalities. Like the layer and abstract design paradigm of modern operation systems and computer networks, the data layer serves as an abstraction layer, providing immense flexibility and interchangeability of various data sources, supporting applications, and adapting to other components and environments. This also accelerates the growth of smart-world systems and their integration in different application domains (smart grid, smart transportation, smart manufacturing, smart cities, smart healthcare, etc.). To this end, this paper presents a new data layer structure to support CPS applications and the integration of multiple CPS. We propose a hierarchical architecture to synthesize DT techniques as an independent layer in our architecture, deeply integrated into existing CPS. We discuss key issues: leveraging the data layer to support applications in various CPS, incorporating the data layer and physical layer, and building a data layer using distributed computing, naming services, etc. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions based on the presented new data layer architecture for CPS.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3674974,3,,,,,,,Cheng Qian and Yifan Guo and Adamu Hussaini and Abubakar Musa and Akshita Sai and Wei Yu,10.1145/3674974,1533-5399,,ACM Trans.

To address this gap, the present paper leverages insights from STS and International Relations to explore how different expert communities have constructed AI as a governance problem. More specifically, it presents the preliminary results of a qualitative frame analysis of 90 policy documents published by experts from industry, civil society, and the research community. The analysis finds that AI expertise is a highly contested field, as experts not only disagree on why AI is problematic and what policies are required, but, more fundamentally, about which artifacts, ideas, and practices make up AI in the first place. The paper proposes that the epistemic disagreements concerning AI have political consequences, as they engender protracted ontological politics that jeopardize the development of effective governance interventions. Against this background, the findings raise critical questions about the prevailing tendency of governance interventions to target the elusive and contested object 'artificial intelligence.'",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3514094.3534161,3,,,,,,,Hendrik R Schopmans,10.1145/3514094.3534161,,,,"artificial intelligence,epistemic community,experts,frame analysis.,global governance,governance objects",,,627-640,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3514094.3534161,2022,"New York, NY, USA",

So this requires a new type of network that can dynamically update the domain. To enhance the real-time responsiveness of regional communication involving controllers and controlled devices, it is essential for the network to establish dynamic local connections that adapt to the spatial location changes of cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, or production line logistics. As a response to this requirement, this paper introduces a novel edge computing distributed communication network and a dynamically updated domain identity architecture. Every endpoint node has the capability to autonomously form a local cluster based on its spatial location for signal transmission. By dynamically polling and accessing this cluster, it achieves close sharing of sensors and AI computing power, leading to a cost reduction in building a comprehensive intelligent control system compared to traditional single-machine AI systems. This holds significant potential for advancing the implementation of comprehensive AI projects.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3603273.3636496,3,,,,,,,Weibin Su and Ivy Kim D Machica and Cristina E Dumdumaya and Randy S Gamboa and Gang Xu and Zhengfang He,10.1145/3603273.3636496,,,,"AIoT,DDS,Dynamic Domain ID,Edge Computing",,,107-112,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3603273.3636496,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1550,inproceedings,Augmented Reality and Machine Learning in Health: A Systematic Review,"Augmented Reality (AR) is a useful technology for providing an information-rich reality by superimposing digital objects and giving a virtual interpretation of the physical environment. AR has played a key role in reducing cognitive load and the applications of AR have been useful in various fields ranging from manufacturing, advertisement, education, military, and health. AR has also been deployed on various platforms like mobile, computer screens, and head-mounted displays (HMD). In this paper, we systematically reviewed research papers that have applied AR systems with machine learning (ML) in various health-related domains within the past 12 years (2010–2021). We present a review of the state-of-the-art AR implementation and research in the area of health by (1) identifying various AR approaches, (2) uncovering various areas of health where AR have been applied, (3) determining the current trend, gaps, and areas for future work, (4) highlighting the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms used in the AR systems and how they are used, and (5) comparing the different visualization modalities (web, mobile, and HMD). This review adds to the existing literature by shedding light on the common tools, successful approaches used in implementing previous AR projects, and evaluation methods.

ID-1551,inproceedings,DoodleIt: A Novel Tool and Approach for Teaching How CNNs Perform Image Recognition,"To introduce middle school students to key concepts in image recognition, we created an interactive web application that performs sketch recognition and an afterschool curriculum for its use. Our app, called DoodleIt, was inspired by Google’s Quick, Draw!, and makes use of its accompanying open-source sketch library. With DoodleIt, students make simple line drawings on a canvas area and a previously-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) identifies the object drawn. The application dynamically visualizes the different layers that are involved in the process of CNNs, including a display of kernels, the resulting feature maps, and the percentage of match at output neurons. We used DoodleIt in an 18-hour curriculum to introduce middle school students to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. Four hours of content were related to image recognition and the ethics of using AI. Here, we describe the design of the DoodleIt application, the approach we used to introduce the associated ideas to the students, and how we assessed student learning. Qualitative data collected from students are presented and discussed. Our findings indicate that students were able to understand the functionality of the kernels and feature maps involved in the CNN to perform rudimentary image recognition.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3576123.3576127,3,,,,,,,Vaishali Mahipal and Srija Ghosh and Ismaila Temitayo Sanusi and Ruizhe Ma and Joseph E Gonzales and Fred G Martin,10.1145/3576123.3576127,,,,"Artificial Intelligence,Convolution Neural Networks,Feature Maps,Image Recognition,K-12 Students,Kernels,Middle School Students",,,31-38,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3576123.3576127,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1552,inproceedings,(Anti)-Intentional Harms: The Conceptual Pitfalls of Emotion AI in Education,"‘Emotion AI’ is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that claim to be able to detect the inner emotional states of individuals by collecting biometric information such as face scans, voice recordings, and traces of physical movement. Despite their growing popularity in education, these systems have the potential to produce serious harm. In this paper, we argue that a major concern with emotion AI technologies has to do with the theories of emotion that undergird them. Most emotion AI technologies are built on the foundations of anti-intentionalist theories of human emotion, which claim that emotions can be understood as discrete, universal states that arise as automatic physiological responses. Anti-intentionalists suggest that emotions are not directed at any object, or subject to cognitive reasons. In our work, we focus on the increasing use of these technologies in education to illustrate the ways in which these anti-intentionalist systems are problematic, as they dissolve the space for pushback against the judgements they make. We argue that their use thereby contributes to harms towards children broadly centered around student disempowerment, surveillance, and classification. We then consider three alternative policy approaches to emotion AI use in schools in light of their role with this political agenda of emotion commodification, assessing each of these options—interpretability, technical reform, and non-use—for their desirability and feasibility. In doing so, we underscore the conceptual harms produced by emotion AI systems in the context of education, and the criteria by which these technologies should be judged by educators and policymakers.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3593013.3594088,3,,,,,,,Nathalie DiBerardino and Luke Stark,10.1145/3593013.3594088,,,,"Basic Emotion Theory (BET),affect,affective computing,anti-intentionalism,artificial intelligence,digital classroom,education,emotion,emotion AI,human capital,intentionalism,socio-emotional learning (SEL),theories of emotion",,,1386-1395,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3593013.3594088,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1553,inproceedings,Discrete Intelligible Recognition Network,"We present a new approach to recognize object and we test it in MNIST data set. The main purpose of this method is to solve some problems encountered by most current artificial intelligence. Firstly, most current artificial intelligence is incomprehensible. Second, most AI algorithm use a large number of additions and multiplications, but in our brain, it will be difficult to implement or learn multipliers automatically, and gradient descent is also difficult to achieve. In our method, we hope that we can implement a kind of algorithm that does not use gradient descent and may not use adders and multipliers and the algorithm is comprehensible. We propose a new method. The method does not use multipliers and adders as much as possible. For intelligibility, we discretize the parameters of the entire algorithm. The parameters can be regarded as an encoding. Algorithm recognizes objects by means of comparators. It first needs to remember the identified object and decompose this object into smaller objects through continuous learning, and grasp more changes of objects by creating more branches. Because the algorithm is identified by comparing similarities, we can learn how the object is identified by the path of the algorithm's execution, and thus understand how the algorithm makes decisions.

Next, I will present the recent progress that allows for more reasonable human interaction where the human input is taken as ""advice"" and the learning algorithm combines this advice with data. The advice can be in the form of qualitative influences, preferences over labels/actions, privileged information obtained during training or simple precision-recall trade-off. Finally, I will outline our recent work on ""closing-the-loop"" where information is solicited from humans as needed that allows for seamless interactions with the human expert.

The benefits of AI are indisputable. However, there are several concerns regarding the security of the deployed AI models, such as reverse engineering and Intellectual Property (IP) piracy. Accumulating a sufficiently large amount of data - building, training, improvement, and model deployment require immense human and computational power, making the process expensive. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to protect the model against IP infringement. We propose AIME, a novel watermarking framework that captures model inaccuracy during the training phase and converts it into the owner-specific unique signature. The watermark is embedded within the class mispredictions of the DNN model. Watermark extraction is performed when the model is queried by an owner-specific sequence of key inputs, and the signature is decoded from the sequence of model predictions. AIME works with negligible watermark embedding runtime overhead while preserving the accurate functionality of the DNN. We have performed a comprehensive evaluation of AIME, which models on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 dataset and corroborated its effectiveness, robustness, and performance.",,3,,,,,,,Dhwani Mehta and Nurun Mondol and Farimah Farahmandi and Mark Tehranipoor,,,,,"artificial intelligence,deep learning,intellectual property piracy,watermarking",,,304-309,,European Design and Automation Association,,,2022,"Leuven, BEL",
ID-1559,inproceedings,Prototype of deployment of Federated Learning with IoT devices,"In the age of technology, data is an increasingly important resource. This importance is growing in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where sub fields such as Machine Learning (ML) need more and more data to achieve better results. Internet of Things (IoT) is the connection of sensors and smart objects to collect and exchange data, in addition to achieving many other tasks. A huge amount of the resource desired, data, is stored in mobile devices, sensors and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, but remains there due to data protection restrictions. At the same time these devices do not have enough data or computational capacity to train good models. Moreover, transmitting, storing and processing all this data on a centralised server is problematic. Federated Learning (FL) provides an innovative solution that allows devices to learn in a collaborative way. More importantly, it accomplishes this without violating data protection laws. FL is currently growing, and there are several solutions that implement it. This article presents a prototype of a FL solution where the IoT devices used were raspberry pi boards. The results compare the performance of a solution of this type with those obtained in traditional approaches. In addition, the FL solution performance was tested in a hostile environment.

An important challenge remains in how AI accelerators are programmed to sustain high utilization without impacting end-user productivity. Prior software optimizations start with an input graph and focus on node-level optimizations, viz. dataflows and hierarchical tiling, and graph-level optimizations such as operation fusion. However, little effort has been devoted to inter-node on-chip scratchpad memory (SPM) management in Deep Learning (DL) accelerators, whose significance is bolstered by the recent trends in complex network topologies and the emergence of eager execution in DL frameworks.We characterize and show that there exists up to a 5.2 performance gap in DL inference to be bridged using SPM management and propose OnSRAM, a novel SPM management framework integrated with the compiler runtime of a DL accelerator. We develop two variants, viz. &nbsp;OnSRAM-Static, which works on static graphs to identify data structures that can be lucratively held on-chip based on their size, liveness and significance, and OnSRAM-Eager, which targets an eager execution model (no graph) and uses a history-based speculative scheme to hold/discard data structures. We integrate OnSRAM &nbsp;with TensorFlow and analyze it on multiple accelerator configurations. Across a suite of 12 images, objects, and language networks, on a 3&nbsp;TFLOP system with a 2&nbsp;MB SPM and 32&nbsp;GBps external memory bandwidth, OnSRAM-Static &nbsp;and OnSRAM-Eager &nbsp;achieve 1.02–4.8 and 1.02–3.1 reduction in inference latency (batch size of 1), over a baseline with no SPM management.

ID-1568,inproceedings,Integration of&nbsp;TinyML-based proximity and couch sensing in wearable devices for monitoring infectious disease's social distance compliance,"With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), there has been a rapid increase in the use of sensors to intelligently monitor the environment and movement of objects. Smart solutions have been widely used for monitoring infectious diseases by limiting the transmission of contagious diseases using proximity sensing systems. This is an alternative to conventional social distancing technologies like Bluetooth and cameras which uses machine learning (ML), image processing to identify trespassers, and multiple object detection in real-time. This paper leverages the emerging Tiny ML technology to design and develop a wearable device that can prevent infectious diseases from spreading. The device senses the cough sound of the nearest person within a limited distance and then identify the nearest objects such as humans, animals (dog, goats), and wind-blown vegetation, based on patterns of PIR signals bounced back from different objects.&nbsp; By using machine learning algorithms, the device can be able to notify the user when they are in a safe environment or not. This solution is a wearable device that has the potential to be used in monitoring the transmission of contagious diseases by detecting and identifying moving objects and alerting people to keep their distance when they are in an unsafe environment with a&nbsp;high risk of being exposed to the disease. This work-focused research project will particularly focus on monitoring the risk environment to prevent infectious diseases between humans and between humans and animals, reminding users to keep their distance for their safety and the use of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm on the device for identifying moving objects and for detecting cough. The system has been evaluated, and the experiments have shown a performance accuracy of 92.1% for object detection and 68% for cough detection, promising for detecting a safe environment.&nbsp; This accuracy could be increased over time via reinforcement learning.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3587828.3587880,3,,,,,,,Ritha M Umutoni and Marvin M Ogore and Rosette L Savanna and Damien Hanyurwimfura and Jimmy Nsenga and Didacienne Mukanyirigira and Frederic Nzanywayingoma and Desire Ngabo and Joseph Habiyaremye,10.1145/3587828.3587880,,,,"CNN,infectious diseases,moving objects,risk environment,wearable device",,,349-355,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3587828.3587880,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1569,inproceedings,Achiever or explorer? gamifying the creation process of training data for machine learning,"The development of artificial intelligence, e. g., for Computer Vision, through supervised learning requires the input of large amounts of annotated or labeled data objects as training data. The creation of high-quality training data is usually done manually which can be repetitive and tiring. Gamification, the use of game elements in a non-game context, is one method to make tedious tasks more interesting. This paper proposes a multi-step process for gamifying the manual creation of training data for machine learning purposes. We choose a user-adapted approach based on the results of a preceding user study with the target group (employees of an AI software development company) which helped us to identify annotation use cases and the users' player characteristics. The resulting concept includes levels of increasing difficulty, tutorials, progress indicators and a narrative built around a robot character which at the same time is a user assistant. The implemented prototype is an extension of the company's existing annotation tool and serves as a basis for further observations.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3404983.3405519,3,,,,,,,Sarah Alaghbari and Annett Mitschick and Gregor Blichmann and Martin Voigt and Raimund Dachselt,10.1145/3404983.3405519,,,,"gamification,machine learning,object labeling,training data",,,173-181,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3404983.3405519,2020,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1572,inproceedings,Energy-Efficient AI over a Virtualized Cloud Fog Network,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have served as a catalyst in introducing a plethora of next-generation services in the era of Internet of Things (IoT), thanks to the availability of massive amounts of data collected by the objects on the edge. Currently, DNN models are used to deliver many Artificial Intelligence (AI) services that include image and natural language processing, speech recognition, and robotics. Accordingly, such services utilize various DNN models that make it computationally intensive for deployment on the edge devices alone. Thus, most AI models are offloaded to distant cloud data centers (CDCs), which tend to consolidate large amounts of computing and storage resources into one or more CDCs. Deploying services in the CDC will inevitably lead to excessive latencies and overall increase in power consumption. Instead, fog computing allows for cloud services to be extended to the edge of the network, which allows for data processing to be performed closer to the end-user device. However, different from cloud data centers, fog nodes have limited computational power and are highly distributed in the network. In this paper, using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), we formulate the placement of DNN inference models, which is abstracted as a network embedding problem in a Cloud Fog Network (CFN) architecture, where power savings are introduced through trade-offs between processing and networking.

ID-1576,inproceedings,Embedded Deep Inference in Practice: Case for Model Partitioning,"With increased focus on in situ analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are getting deployed on embedded devices at the network edge. Growing popularity of Deep Learning (DL) and inference largely due to minimization of feature engineering, availability of pre-trained models and fine-tunable datasets especially in image and video analytics, have made these de-facto standard. However, the embedded systems employing these models are often resource constrained and fail to handle scenarios where arrival rate and input data volume increase over a given time period. This has a direct effect on the storage and network usage of such devices, rendering the traditional strategies of input buffering and network offloading ineffective. This paper investigates the use of dynamic layer-wise partitioning and partial execution of DL inference phase to enable inelastic embedded systems to support varying sensing rates and large data volume. The proposed partial execution scheme and partitioning algorithm perform better than standard frame-wise inference methods, when evaluated using workloads of few popular CNNs used in standard object detection models.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3362743.3362964,3,,,,,,,Swarnava Dey and Arijit Mukherjee and Arpan Pal and Balamuralidhar P,10.1145/3362743.3362964,,,,"CNN,Cloud,DAG,Edge,Fog,convolution,distributed,elastic",,,25-30,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3362743.3362964,2019,"New York, NY, USA",

If in fact the notion of cosmology applies to AI, is there only one valid AI Cosmology or are there competing valid cosmologies? If there is only one valid cosmology, what is its structure? How far can we take an AI Cosmology analogy? Like our Universe, did AI have the equivalent of a Big Bang? Is the field or structure of AI expanding or contracting? In an interview with Nikola Danaylov, podcaster of Singularity.FM, the late Marvin Minsky, one of the early AI pioneers, suggested that the evolution of AI in the 21st century maybe be contracting or even stalled! We posit that an AI Cosmology would help to educate the general public about our research and work, and its impact on society. Internally, it would help us to fix the objects, structure, and dynamics of the field.

The control based approach is a model-free version of Image Based Visual Servoing (IBVS), which is based on mathematical modeling of the sensing and motion task. The AI approach, here denoted Behavior-Based Visual Servoing (BBVS), contains elements that are biologically plausible and inspired by schema-theory. We show how the two approaches lead to very similar solutions, even identical given a few simplifying assumptions. This similarity is shown both analytically and numerically. However, in a simple picking task with a 3 DoF robot arm, BBVS shows significantly higher performance than the IBVS approach, partly because it contains more manually tuned parameters.

ID-1581,inproceedings,Custom visual recognition model with Watson studio,"The explosive growth of cameras, image sensors, and computer vision as a discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has garnered strong interest from researchers, developers, businesses and consumers. Image classification refers to a process to classify an image according to a model and match it to a set of classes or categories. Object detection is similar to image classification, which is a process to classify, locate and count multiple objects in an image and their respective locations within the image. Object tracking involves using object detection in each frame of a video to track the desired object through a series of image frames or video [1]. There are a number of use cases for computer vision including face recognition for application or device security, automatically counting and classifying items on a production line, and monitoring and responding to traffic conditions on busy road sections.Computer vision seeks to understand information in digital images through processing and analyzing digital images. This understanding is achieved through extracting high dimension data from images and processing them to produce usable information. Practical applications of computer vision in the context of machine learning include classification, segmentation, and tracking [2].IBM Watson Studio (https://www.ibm.com/watson) is IBM's suite of enterprise-ready AI services, applications and tooling. As a service on IBM Cloud, IBM Watson Visual Recognition uses deep learning algorithms to analyze images for scenes, faces, and objects. This service provides built-in models and can also be used to create and train custom models for specific needs. Watson Studio provides a collaborative platform on top of IBM Cloud's cloud computing capabilities to use existing models or train and deploy new models with minimal coding. Watson Studio has the added capability of setting up custom environments and Notebooks, allowing quick, cloud-enabled development machines that can scale as your projects scale.IBM PowerAI Vision (https://www.ibm.com/caen/marketplace/ibm-powerai-vision) is a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerated visual recognition solution running on IBM Power Systems. PowerAI Vision (https://www.ibm.com/caen/marketplace/ibm-powerai-vision) puts data science in the hands of subject matter experts. This tool simplifies building machine learning models with IBM Power Systems. As a result, users can build models and deploy them to the web without coding. The models can be accessed through an Application Program Interface (API). On the other hand, users can call the API from their own applications with a few lines of code.IBM provides developers free, open source, state-of-the-art assets for deep learning through the Model Asset Exchange (MAX) (https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/models/) on IBM Developer. In the repository developers can find both assets for training deep learning models and pre-trained models to use in their projects.The first half of this workshop will focus on exploring the Watson Visual Recognition and Watson Machine Learning Services in IBM Cloud. We will begin by building and deploying a model on Watson Visual Recognition. We will focus on the key benefits of the service, including the ability of anyone with minimal coding experience to be able to train and deploy a computer vision model to the cloud. We will then demonstrate how easy it can be to integrate the model in any web-enabled application through a demo web application. Once this has been completed, we will give a soft introduction to Watson Machine Learning, including how to choose development environments, setting up a Jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/), and go over some prepared code snippets to train and analyze a model fully on the cloud. [We will then demonstrate how we can export the model and use it in our applications.In the second half of the workshop, we will demonstrate detecting and labeling objects within an image using PowerAI Vision object detection (https://github.com/IBM/powerai-vision-object-detection), based on customized training. Instead of writing code to train, deploy, and test the new model, we will only need to upload the images, and label the objects in the provided application. Once the model is deployed, we will use the PowerAI Vision user interface (UI) to test it. We will also use our application as a Representational State Transfer (REST) client to locate and count objects in an image using the provided REST API endpoint. At the end of the workshop we will briefly introduce Model Asset Exchange, we will demonstrate how to find a visual recognition model on MAX, deploy it as a microservice and test it.In summary, we will introduce some visual recognition services provided by IBM in this workshop. We together will develop an image classification model using Watson Visual Recognition service with Watson Studio. We also consume a visual recognition service from a client side. Then we discuss the features of PowerAI Vision and demonstrate object detection in PowerAI Vision.

In this paper, we investigate AI “hallucination” by stress-testing a visual storytelling algorithm with different visual and textual inputs designed to probe dream logic inspired by cinematic surrealism. Following a close reading of 100 visual stories that we deem artificial dreams, we describe how AI “hallucination” in computational visual storytelling is the opposite of groundedness: literary expression that is ungrounded in the visual or textual inputs.

AI systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and ways they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3457607,3,,,,,,,Ninareh Mehrabi and Fred Morstatter and Nripsuta Saxena and Kristina Lerman and Aram Galstyan,10.1145/3457607,0360-0300,6,ACM Comput.

ID-1585,inproceedings,Diffusion of Innovation on Auditor Adoption of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,"The industrial revolution (4.0) has seen a rapid advancement in technology. The existence of machine learning and artificial intelligence is one of them. By automating most audit processes with AI, auditors can increase efficiency and accuracy. AI-powered technology reduces human error risk while speeding up the auditing process. The outcome is more timely and accurate information sent to the management. Nonetheless, auditors were still using artificial intelligence and machine learning in very small amounts. Furthermore, specialized research on this subject is still scarce. We wish to investigate this research gap. We study what influences artificial intelligence and machine learning adoption by auditors. Based on Diffusion of Innovation Theory, we employ constructs or variables. Structural equation modeling partial least squares is used in data analysis for our quantitative research. By giving questionnaires to Jakarta public accounting firms' auditors, we can gather primary data. We use the statistical method of partial least squares for structural equation modeling when analyzing data. The software we use is SMART PLS version 4.

ID-1590,article,Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue: A Collection of Best Practices for AI Governance and Engineering,"Responsible Artificial Intelligence (RAI) is widely considered as one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time and is key to increase the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recently, a number of AI ethics principles frameworks have been published. However, without further guidance on best practices, practitioners are left with nothing much beyond truisms. In addition, significant efforts have been placed at algorithm level rather than system level, mainly focusing on a subset of mathematics-amenable ethical principles, such as fairness. Nevertheless, ethical issues can arise at any step of the development lifecycle, cutting across many AI and non-AI components of systems beyond AI algorithms and models. To operationalize RAI from a system perspective, in this article, we present an RAI Pattern Catalogue based on the results of a multivocal literature review. Rather than staying at the principle or algorithm level, we focus on patterns that AI system stakeholders can undertake in practice to ensure that the developed AI systems are responsible throughout the entire governance and engineering lifecycle. The RAI Pattern Catalogue classifies the patterns into three groups: multi-level governance patterns, trustworthy process patterns, and RAI-by-design product patterns. These patterns provide systematic and actionable guidance for stakeholders to implement RAI.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3626234,3,,,,,,,Qinghua Lu and Liming Zhu and Xiwei Xu and Jon Whittle and Didar Zowghi and Aurelie Jacquet,10.1145/3626234,0360-0300,7,ACM Comput.

ID-1599,inproceedings,Evolving Towards a Trustworthy AIEd Model to Predict at Risk Students in Introductory Programming Courses,"Artificial intelligence in education has the potential to transform the educational landscape and influence the role of the involved stakeholders. With recent European Commission publications on the use of artificial intelligence and data in education and training, in addition to the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and the forthcoming AI act, there is now a precedent that using AI, in and for education, needs to be more trustworthy (transparent and explainable) to be considered for adoption. This paper further develops an AIEd model (PreSS - Predicting Student Success) that has been developed, validated and re-validated over almost two decades, focusing on explainability and transparency. PreSS aims to identify students who are at risk of failing or dropping out of introductory programming courses. This paper presents our recent work to describe PreSS in the context of a trustworthy model, that is both explainable and transparent. First, for explainability, we present Explainable AI (XAI) approaches to describe how predictions are made, and what set of inputs leads to such decisions, which has not been presented before for PreSS. Second, to examine transparency, we present confusion metrics, focusing first on predicting the performance of all students and then on performance at sub-group level such as by gender and age. Finally, we present a model card illustrating where the model performs well and where it does not.

ID-1605,inproceedings,A Quantitative Analysis of Offensive Cyber Operation (OCO) Automation Tools,"The ecosystem for automated offensive security tools has grown in recent years. As more tools automate offensive security techniques via Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), it may result in vulnerabilities due to adversarial attacks. Therefore, it is imperative that research is conducted to help understand the techniques used by these security tools. Our work explores the current state of the art in offensive security tools. First, we employ an abstract model that can be used to understand what phases of an Offensive Cyber Operation (OCO) can be automated. We then adopt a generalizable taxonomy, and apply it to automation tools (such as normal automation and the use of artificial intelligence in automation). We then curated a dataset of tools and research papers and quantitatively analyzed it. Our work resulted in a public dataset that includes analysis of (n=57) papers and OCO tools that are mapped to the the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework enterprise techniques, applicable phases of our OCO model, and the details of the automation technique. The results show a need for a granular expansion on the ATT&amp;CK Exploit Public-Facing application technique.

Adoption, however, remains low. AI’s entry into complex socio-techno-legal systems raises issues of transparency, specifically for regulators. However, the perspective of supervisors, regulators who monitor compliance with applicable financial regulations, has rarely been studied. This paper focuses on understanding the needs of supervisors in anti-money laundering (AML) to better inform the design of AI justifications and explanations in highly regulated fields. Through scenario-based workshops with 13 supervisors and 6 banking professionals, we outline the auditing practices and socio-technical context of the supervisor. By combining the workshops’ insights with an analysis of compliance requirements, we identify the AML obligations that conflict with AI opacity. We then formulate seven needs that supervisors have for model justifiability.

ID-1623,article,ID-SR: Privacy-Preserving Social Recommendation Based on Infinite Divisibility for Trustworthy AI,"Recommendation systems powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are widely used to improve user experience. However, AI inevitably raises privacy leakage and other security issues due to the utilization of extensive user data. Addressing these challenges can protect users’ personal information, benefit service providers, and foster service ecosystems. Presently, numerous techniques based on differential privacy have been proposed to solve this problem. However, existing solutions encounter issues such as inadequate data utilization and a tenuous trade-off between privacy protection and recommendation effectiveness. To enhance recommendation accuracy and protect users’ private data, we propose ID-SR, a novel privacy-preserving social recommendation scheme for trustworthy AI based on the infinite divisibility of Laplace distribution. We first introduce a novel recommendation method adopted in ID-SR, which is established based on matrix factorization with a newly designed social regularization term for improving recommendation effectiveness. We then propose a differential privacy-preserving scheme tailored to the above method that leverages the Laplace distribution’s characteristics to safeguard user data. Theoretical analysis and experimentation evaluation on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our scheme achieves a superior balance between privacy protection and recommendation effectiveness, ultimately delivering an enhanced user experience.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3639412,3,,,,,,,Jingyi Cui and Guangquan Xu and Jian Liu and Shicheng Feng and Jianli Wang and Hao Peng and Shihui Fu and Zhaohua Zheng and Xi Zheng and Shaoying Liu,10.1145/3639412,1556-4681,7,ACM Trans.

We report widespread perception that AI will have significant impact on society, accompanied by strong support for the responsible development and use of AI, and also characterize the public's sentiment towards AI with four key themes (exciting, useful, worrying, and futuristic) whose prevalence distinguishes response to AI in different countries.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3461702.3462605,3,,,,,,,Patrick Gage Kelley and Yongwei Yang and Courtney Heldreth and Christopher Moessner and Aaron Sedley and Andreas Kramm and David T Newman and Allison Woodruff,10.1145/3461702.3462605,,,,"artificial intelligence,public perception",,,627-637,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3461702.3462605,2021,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1625,inproceedings,Scratch-NB: A Scratch Extension for Introducing K-12 Learners to Supervised Machine Learning,"Artificial Intelligence has rapidly captured-again-the attention of practitioners and the CS Education community. Several initiatives have been spawning to identify effective ways to introduce learners at college and high-school levels to the basics of AI. In this context, we developed Scratch-NB, an extension to the Scratch programming language to equip K-8 learners with foundational tools for developing a Naive-Bayes classifier, explicitly transparenting its internal components. We opted to use Scratch due to its popularity within the CS4All movement and its predominance in schools, and extend the language with a simple implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier as a gateway for introducing basic notions of supervised learning and AI. In this paper, we report the design rationale of our tool and our experience of using it in an informal workshop with children aged 10-12 with no prior knowledge of computational thinking, coding, or AI. The obtained results show that Scratch-NB showed high levels of acceptance among the participants, raised interest in AI, and effectively provided basic foundations, particularly when comparing Scratch-NB with other state-of-the-art tools targeted to this learner group. We argue that our tool has the potential to illuminate further practical and research endeavors when exploring how to effectively introduce younger populations to the foundational notions of AI in practical contexts.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3626252.3630920,3,,,,,,,Patricio Quiroz and Francisco J Gutierrez,10.1145/3626252.3630920,,,,"ai education,classification,k-8 education,naive bayes,scratch",,,1077-1083,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3626252.3630920,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1626,inproceedings,Decoding Anomalies! Unraveling Operational Challenges in Human-in-the-Loop Anomaly Validation,"Artificial intelligence has been driving new industrial solutions for challenging problems in recent years, with many companies leveraging AI to enhance business processes and products. Automated anomaly detection emerges as one of the top priorities in AI adoption, sought after by numerous small to large-scale enterprises. Extending beyond domain-specific applications like software log analytics, where anomaly detection has perhaps garnered the most interest in software engineering, we find that very little research effort has been devoted to post-anomaly detection, such as validating anomalies. For example, validating anomalies requires human-in-the-loop interaction, though working with human experts is challenging due to uncertain requirements on how to elicit valuable feedback from them, posing formidable operationalizing challenges. In this study, we provide an experience report delving into a more holistic view of the complexities of adopting effective anomaly detection models from a requirement engineering perspective. We address challenges and provide solutions to mitigate challenges associated with operationalizing anomaly detection from diverse perspectives: inherent issues in dynamic datasets, diverse business contexts, and the dynamic interplay between human expertise and AI guidance in the decision-making process. We believe our experience report will provide insights for other companies looking to adopt anomaly detection in their own business settings.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3663529.3663857,3,,,,,,,Dong Jae Kim and Steven Locke and Tse-Hsun (Peter) Chen and Andrei Toma and Sarah Sajedi and Steve Sporea and Laura Weinkam,10.1145/3663529.3663857,,,,"Anomaly Validation,Requirement Engineering",,,382-387,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3663529.3663857,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1628,article,The Adoption of Artificial Intelligence in Bureaucratic Decision-making: A Weberian Perspective,"This work questions AI´s role in bureaucratic decision-making. The Weberian conception of bureaucracy, based around the concept of an ideal bureaucracy in which authority is distributed, delegated, clearly delimited and hierarchical and that enshrines the following of formal rules, task specialization through division of labor, legal certainty and a predilection for efficiency in recordable and accountable decisions can serve as a framework to orient how governments should approach the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) given the many problems associated with its careless deployment. Using theoretical analysis, this work explains Weberian ideas of bureaucracy and contrasts them with real-life cases of implementation of AI in bureaucratic decision-making, often with detrimental results for society. After identifying and framing issues related to AI, e.g., lack of transparency, attempts to shift accountability from humans to technology, the exacerbation of bias and potential for systemic discrimination, the paper proposes Weberian prescriptions that should help public administration make careful decisions about the adoption of AI and the consequences of its implementation. The article also engages with Weber critically, rejecting the notion that public administrators do not engage in politics and asserting that AI decision-making is necessarily political as well, as it entails exercising power over citizens.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3609861,3,,,,,,,Rodrigo Cetina Presuel and Jose M Martinez Sierra,10.1145/3609861,,1,Digit.

To contribute to this growing body of knowledge, in this study, we aim to explore the adoption of AI-based programming assistants in the Brazilian industry. More specifically, we aim to understand how practitioners of a particular Brazilian agroindustry-related company perceive and use AI-based tools to develop software. Using an online survey, we collected and analyzed 72 responses from employees of the studied company. Our findings suggest that practitioners mainly adopt ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, interacting with these tools to accelerate online searching, typing, and syntax recall. A recurrent difficulty is the lack of context in the suggestions provided by these tools, but participants work on detailed descriptions to contextualize and cope with this challenge. Among the reasons for not using AI-based tools, the most influential is that participants use a commercial programming language, i.e., Uniface, which these tools lack examples.

In this paper, we provide a catalog of 30 green architectural tactics for ML-enabled systems to fill this gap. An architectural tactic is a high-level design technique to improve software quality, in our case environmental sustainability. We derived the tactics from the analysis of 51 peer-reviewed publications that primarily explore Green AI, and validated them using a focus group approach with three experts. The 30 tactics we identified are aimed to serve as an initial reference guide for further exploration into Green AI from a software engineering perspective, and assist in designing sustainable ML-enabled systems. To enhance transparency and facilitate their widespread use and extension, we make the tactics available online in easily consumable formats.

Similar initiatives in Africa are little known. The literature highlights the potential and opportunities/challenges of implementing emerging technologies. However, the research rarely addresses how to implement such technologies in Africa for sustainable development, and the associated challenges often lead to abandoned solutions in the early stages. This paper explores the application of emerging technologies in Africa to determine the challenges associated with the implementation and derive recommendations for responsible designs.

ID-1641,inproceedings,The unfair side of Privacy Enhancing Technologies: addressing the trade-offs between PETs and fairness,"Data sharing in the European Union (EU) has gained new momentum, among others for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) training purposes. By enabling models’ training whilst preserving the privacy of data, Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) have therefore gained popularity, especially among policymakers. So far, computer science research has focused on advancing state-of-the-art privacy engineering and exploring trade-offs between privacy and accuracy. Meanwhile, legal scholarship began investigating the challenges arising therefrom. Yet, few works have delved into the fairness implications of PETs. Further research is essential to both prevent the propagation of bias and discrimination and to limit the accumulation of market power within very few economic entities suitable to undermine fair competition and consumer rights. In our work, we will address this knowledge gap by adopting a legal and computer science point of view. After scoping our understanding of possible unfair sides of PETs based on technical and socio-legal understandings of fairness (Section 2), we provide an overview of PETs mostly relevant for ML and AI training (Section 3). We then discuss fairness-related challenges arising from their use (Section 4) and we suggest possible technical and regulatory (e.g., impact assessment, new rights) solutions to address the shortcomings identified (Section 5).

ID-1642,inproceedings,Arabic Sentiment Analysis with Noisy Deep Explainable Model,"Sentiment Analysis (SA) is an essential task for numerous real-world applications. However, the majority of SA research focuses on high-resource languages such as English and Chinese, while limited-resource languages like Arabic and Bengali receive less attention. Additionally, existing Arabic sentiment analysis methods based on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) approaches tend to operate as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend the reasoning behind their predictions. This paper proposes an explainable sentiment classification framework for the Arabic language. We introduce a noise layer to different deep learning (DL) models, including BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM, to address the issue of overfitting. The proposed framework enables the explanation of specific predictions by training a local surrogate explainable model, shedding light on the reasons behind each sentiment prediction (positive or negative). Experiments were conducted on publicly available benchmark Arabic SA datasets, and the results demonstrated that the inclusion of noise layers in the DL model improves performance for the Arabic language by mitigating overfitting. Our method also outperformed several state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the introduction of explainability with the noise layer enhances transparency and accountability, making the model suitable for practical adoption in AI-enabled systems.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3639233.3639241,3,,,,,,,Md.

In particular, software engineering has been profoundly affected by the transformative power of disruptive innovations for decades, with a significant impact of technical advancements on social dynamics due to its socio-technical nature. In this paper, we reflect on the importance of formulating and addressing research problems in software engineering through a socio-technical lens, thus ensuring a holistic understanding of the complex phenomena in this field. We propose a research playbook with the aim of providing a guide to formulate compelling and socially relevant research questions and to identify the appropriate research strategies for empirical investigations, with an eye on the long-term implications of technologies or their use. We showcase how to apply the research playbook. Firstly, we show how it can be used retrospectively to reflect on a prior disruptive technology, Stack Overflow, and its impact on software development. Secondly, we show how it can be used to question the impact of two current disruptive technologies: AI and AR/VR. Finally, we introduce a specialized GPT model to support the researcher in framing future investigations.

Explainable AI aims to make algorithmic decision-making more transparent to humans. As future vehicles become more intelligent and user-adaptive, explainability will play an important role ensuring that drivers understand the AI system's functionalities and outputs. However, when integrating explainability into in-vehicle features there is a lack of knowledge about user needs and requirements and how to address them. We conducted a study with 59 participants focusing on how end-users evaluate explainability in the context of user-adaptive comfort and infotainment features. Results show that explanations foster perceived understandability and transparency of the system, but that the need for explanation may vary between features. Additionally, we found that insufficiently designed explanations can decrease acceptance of the system. Our findings underline the requirement for a user-centered approach in explainable AI and indicate approaches for future research.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3543174.3546846,3,,,,,,,Julia Graefe and Selma Paden and Doreen Engelhardt and Klaus Bengler,10.1145/3543174.3546846,,,,"Human-AI interaction,explainable AI,intelligent vehicles,user studies,user-adaptive",,,297-306,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3543174.3546846,2022,"New York, NY, USA",

Examining the Impact of Gender, Age, and Cultural Differences on the Envisioned Future Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Humankind","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prominent in the contemporary digital era, affecting various aspects of daily life across the globe. Public perceptions of AI encompass a diverse array of individual attitudes toward this technology, ranging from favorable to unfavorable. Given the strong predictive relationship between attitudes toward technology and its acceptance and usage, it is vital to understand the factors that shape these attitudes. This article investigates the potential impact of sociodemographic factors, such as country (UK and USA), age, and gender differences, on future perspectives of AI, focusing on the extent to which individuals perceive AI technology as a threat to humans or as a positive for humanity. By comparing samples of respondents from the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (USA), the study aimed to understand how these factors might contribute to variations in attitudes toward AI across diverse cultural contexts. The study examined three main hypotheses, proposing that cultural context, age, and gender influence future perspectives of AI as a potential threat or benefit for humanity. The findings revealed distinct patterns of attitudes towards AI technology among respondents from the UK and the USA, as well as across gender groups. These results contribute to a better understanding of the factors shaping attitudes toward AI. In conclusion, the study underscores the importance of considering cultural context, age, and gender differences in shaping future perspectives on AI, potentially providing valuable insights for further research on the acceptability and deployment of this technology.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3605655.3605669,3,,,,,,,Simone Grassini and Alexander S\ae\{\}vild Ree,10.1145/3605655.3605669,,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3605655.3605669,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

However, due to limited edge resources and the relatively high resource consumption of the model, deploying the appropriate model to ensure good inference accuracy can be challenging. In this work, we model this problem whose aim is to maximize overall efficiency and benefit by selecting AI models pre-trained on cloud servers to be deployed to edge servers. However, the benefit of a pre-trained model is unable to predict due to the dynamic stochastic inputs of users, which can only be disclosed to us after the inference task is executed. Therefore, we improve on the classic algorithm and propose an algorithm for selecting pre-trained models for edge servers based on the multi-armed bandit. With rigorous proof, we prove that regret grows sub-linearly along with time. We also conduct experiments and show the superiority of our algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630138.3630546,3,,,,,,,Jia Wu and Wenjie Li and Wenjun Qi and Liming Wang and Yong Zhao and Yonghui Yan and Mingzhu Xu and Longlong Dou and Bo Xu and Runze Ma and Mingtao Ji,10.1145/3630138.3630546,,,,"Edge Intelligence,Model Deployment,Multi-Armed Bandit",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630138.3630546,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

While most research in this domain focuses on developing fair AI algorithms, in this work, we examine the challenges which arise when humans and fair AI interact. Our results show that due to an apparent conflict between human preferences and fairness, a fair AI algorithm on its own may be insufficient to achieve its intended results in the real world. Using college major recommendation as a case study, we build a fair AI recommender by employing gender debiasing machine learning techniques. Our offline evaluation showed that the debiased recommender makes fairer career recommendations without sacrificing its accuracy in prediction. Nevertheless, an online user study of more than 200 college students revealed that participants on average prefer the original biased system over the debiased system. Specifically, we found that perceived gender disparity is a determining factor for the acceptance of a recommendation. In other words, we cannot fully address the gender bias issue in AI recommendations without addressing the gender bias in humans. We conducted a follow-up survey to gain additional insights into the effectiveness of various design options that can help participants to overcome their own biases.

This model is compared with convolutional neural network and vision transformer-based architectures in terms of mapping accuracy for flooded areas. A benchmark dataset, Sen1Floods11, is used in the experiments, and the models' predictability, generalizability, and transferability are evaluated based on both a test dataset and a dataset that is completely unseen by the model. Results show the good transferability of the Prithvi model, highlighting its performance advantages in segmenting flooded areas in previously unseen regions.

ID-1653,article,Optimal Treatment Strategies for Critical Patients with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Personalized clinical decision support systems are increasingly being adopted due to the emergence of data-driven technologies, with this approach now gaining recognition in critical care. The task of incorporating diverse patient conditions and treatment procedures into critical care decision-making can be challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of medical data. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, enables the development of personalized treatment strategies for severe illnesses by using a learning agent to recommend optimal policies. In this study, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model with a tailored reward function and an LSTM-GRU-derived state representation to formulate optimal treatment policies for vasopressor administration in stabilizing patient physiological states in critical care settings. Using an ICU dataset and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset, we focus on patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that has led to Sepsis, to derive optimal policies that can prioritize patient recovery over patient survival. Both the DDQN (RepDRL-DDQN) and Dueling DDQN (RepDRL-DDDQN) versions of the DRL model surpass the baseline performance, with the proposed model’s learning agent achieving an optimal learning process across our performance measuring schemes. The robust state representation served as the foundation for enhancing the model’s performance, ultimately providing an optimal treatment policy focused on rapid patient recovery.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3643856,3,,,,,,,Simi Job and Xiaohui Tao and Lin Li and Haoran Xie and Taotao Cai and Jianming Yong and Qing Li,10.1145/3643856,2157-6904,2,ACM Trans.

ID-1656,inproceedings,Beyond principles: Embedding ethical AI risks in public sector risk management practice,"Artificial intelligence (AI) adoption by public sector organizations (PSOs) introduces various ethical risks stemming from a lack of integrating human values into AI design. Addressing these ethical risks is a complex collective responsibility among designers, developers, risk experts, and public sector managers. Embedding these risks in existing risk management practices is crucial for responsible AI adoption, as emphasized by the legal requirements of the EU AI Act. However, the responsibility for managing these ethical risks is often unclear. Public sector organizations face unique challenges due to the complex, uncertain, and rapidly evolving nature of AI technologies, further complicating the management of ethical risks. This paper explores using the Three Lines of Defense (TLoD) risk management model to understand and address these ethical risks in public sector AI adoption. The TLoD model structures risk management across three lines: operational management, risk oversight and compliance, and internal audit. This framework helps to distribute and integrate the collective responsibility for ethical AI risk management within public sector organizations, emphasizing alignment and collaboration among different actors. Through an exploratory study involving a survey and semi-structured interviews with professionals responsible for AI-related risk management in Dutch public sector organizations, we assess the TLoD model's usefulness in addressing ethical AI risks. The study examines the challenges and opportunities in applying the TLoD model to manage ethical risks and identifies the potential gaps in responsibility and oversight. The findings suggest that while the TLoD model offers a valuable lens for distributing risk management responsibilities, there are limitations in addressing the emergent and complex nature of ethical risks in AI adoption.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3657054.3657063,3,,,,,,,Antonia Sattlegger and Nitesh Bharosa,10.1145/3657054.3657063,,,,,,,70-80,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3657054.3657063,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

With the growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in domain-specific professional tasks, it has become increasingly important to help beginning annotators identify how their early-stage knowledge can lead to inaccurate answers, which in turn, helps to ensure quality annotations at scale. To investigate this issue, we conducted a formative study involving eight individuals from the field of disaster management, each possessing varying levels of expertise. The goal was to understand the prevalent factors contributing to disagreements among annotators when classifying Twitter messages related to disasters and to analyze their respective responses. Our analysis identified two primary causes of disagreement between expert and beginner annotators: 1) a lack of contextual knowledge or uncertainty about the situation, and 2) the absence of visual or supplementary cues. Based on these findings, we designed a Context interface, which generates aids that help beginners identify potential mistakes and provide the hidden context of the presented tweet. The summative study compares Context design with two widely used designs in data annotation UI, Highlight and Reasoning-based interfaces. We found significant differences between these designs in terms of attitudinal and behavioral data.

The complexity of those tasks, in both the demands for computational resources and the efficiency of the corresponding approach, increases exponentially, mostly based on the volume and the complexity of the available data. A typical example of such a task is Question Answering (QA), where the data that are selected as a knowledge base for providing answers directly affect the efficiency, accuracy and the computational cost of the whole approach. As a result, when developing a QA tool, it is crucial to take into consideration a number of factors throughout the whole QA pipeline, in order to ensure that the given approach provides the right answers in the most efficient way possible.

ID-1661,inproceedings,The Bureaucratic Challenge to AI Governance: An Empirical Assessment of Implementation at U.S. Federal Agencies,"Can government govern artificial intelligence (AI)? One of the central questions of AI governance surrounds state capacity, namely whether government has the ability to accomplish its policy goals. We study this question by assessing how well the U.S. federal government has implemented three binding laws around AI governance: two executive orders—concerning trustworthy AI in the public sector (E.O. 13,960) and AI leadership (E.O. 13,859)—and the AI in Government Act. We conduct the first systematic empirical assessment of the implementation status of these three laws, which have each been described as central to US AI innovation. First, we track, through extensive research, line-level adoption of each mandated action. Based on publicly available information, we find that fewer than 40 percent of 45 legal requirements could be verified as having been implemented. Second, we research the specific implementation of transparency requirements at up to 220 federal agencies. We find that nearly half of agencies failed to publicly issue AI use case inventories—even when these agencies have demonstrable use cases of machine learning. Even when agencies have complied with these requirements, efforts are inconsistent.

ID-1662,inproceedings,Understanding Older Adults’ Perceptions and Challenges in Using AI-enabled Everyday Technologies,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled everyday technologies could help address age-related challenges like physical impairments and cognitive decline. While recent research studied older adults’ experiences with specific AI-enabled products (e.g., conversational agents and assistive robots), it remains unknown how older adults perceive and experience current AI-enabled everyday technologies in general, which could impact their adoption of future AI-enabled products. We conducted a survey study (N=41) and semi-structured interviews (N=15) with older adults to understand their experiences and perceptions of AI. We found that older adults were enthusiastic about learning and using AI-enabled products, but they lacked learning avenues.

ID-1663,inproceedings,Towards an AI-Centric Requirements Engineering Framework for Trustworthy AI,"Ethical guidelines are an asset for artificial intelligence(AI) development and conforming to them will soon be a procedural requirement once the EU AI Act gets ratified in the European parliament. However, developers often lack explicit knowledge on how to apply these guidelines during the system development process. A literature review of different ethical guidelines from various countries and organizations has revealed inconsistencies in the principles presented and the terminology used to describe such principles. This research begins by identifying the limitations of existing ethical AI development frameworks in performing requirements engineering(RE) processes during the development of trustworthy AI. Recommendations to address those limitations will be proposed to make the frameworks more applicable in the RE process to foster the development of trustworthy AI. This could lead to wider adoption, greater productivity of the AI systems, and reduced workload on humans for non-cognitive tasks. Considering the impact of some of the newer foundation models like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, the vision for this research project is to work towards the development of holistic operationalisable RE guidelines for the development and implementation of trustworthy AI not only on a product level but also on process level.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1109/ICSE-Companion58688.2023.00075,3,,,,,,,Krishna Ronanki,10.1109/ICSE-Companion58688.2023.00075,,,,"AI co-worker,EU AI act,ethical AI,frameworks,guidelines,requirements engineering,trustworthy AI",,,278-280,,IEEE Press,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1109/ICSE-Companion58688.2023.00075,2023,,

ID-1665,inproceedings,Towards Building AI-CPS with NVIDIA Isaac Sim: An Industrial Benchmark and Case Study for Robotics Manipulation,"As a representative cyber-physical system (CPS), robotic manipulators have been widely adopted in various academic research and industrial processes, indicating their potential to act as a universal interface between the cyber and the physical worlds. Recent studies in robotics manipulation have started employing artificial intelligence (AI) approaches as controllers to achieve better adaptability and performance. However, the inherent challenge of explaining AI components introduces uncertainty and unreliability to these AI-enabled robotics systems, necessitating a reliable development platform for system design and performance assessment. As a foundational step towards building reliable AI-enabled robotics systems, in this paper, we propose a public benchmark for robotics manipulation. It leverages NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim as the simulation platform, encompassing eight representative manipulation tasks and multiple AI software controllers. An extensive empirical evaluation is conducted to analyze the performance of AI controllers in solving robotics manipulation tasks, enabling a relatively thorough understanding of their effectiveness. To further demonstrate the applicability of our benchmark, we also developed the first falsification framework that is compatible with Isaac Sim. This framework bridges the gap between traditional falsification methods and modern physics engine-based simulations. The effectiveness of different optimization methods in falsifying AI-enabled robotics manipulation with physical simulators is also examined. Our work not only establishes a foundation for the design and development of AI-enabled robotics systems but also provides practical experience and guidance to practitioners in this field, promoting further research in this critical academic and industrial domain.

Applications include cyber-security, cloud infrastructure, social networks and financial markets. Online learning models that learn continuously and adapt to the potentially evolving data distributions have demonstrated efficiency for big data stream learning.

Many large-scale companies use AI to identify opportunities to improve business processes and products. Despite the promise and perils of AI, many traditional software systems (e.g., taxation or reporting) are implemented without AI in mind. Adopting AI-based capabilities in such software can be challenging due to a lack of resources and uncertainties in requirements. This paper documents our experience working with our industry partner on adopting AI capabilities in enterprise software. The enterprise software receives and processes thousands of user inputs with different configuration settings daily, which makes manual user input verification infeasible. To assist our industry partner, we design and integrate an AI-based input verification framework into the software. However, during the design and integration of the framework, we encounter many challenges that range from the requirement engineering process to the development, adoption, and verification process. We discuss the challenges we encountered and their corresponding solutions while working with our industrial partner to integrate the AI-based input verification framework into their non-AI software.

For the smart grid, adopting AI-based methods has transformed established power system functions into more advanced analogs. However, the unstable operation of AI-based services may misguide operators to make incorrect operational decisions leading to substantial consequences. Accordingly, the rapidly growing market of AI-based services calls for raising awareness of accountability of these services. Accountability in grid services is getting even more challenging with respect to the wide availability of the AI-based methods implemented as libraries and the emergence of AI as a service.A key way forward is through smart grid operators monitoring their AI-based services to enable accountability. Accountable AI increases trustworthiness and accelerates acceptance of these services by society. Toward this, a conceptual representation of a monitoring regime for AI-based services is proposed and major challenges to realising it are identified. In addition, this work aims to draw more attention to AI-based services and the issues they raise, given AI increasing prominence and the general calls for the more responsible and accountable use of AI.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3538637.3539636,3,,,,,,,Anna Volkova and Amit Dilip Patil and Seyyed Ahmad Javadi and Hermann de Meer,10.1145/3538637.3539636,,,,"accountability,artificial intelligence,smart grid",,,597-600,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3538637.3539636,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1671,inproceedings,GMLake: Efficient and Transparent GPU Memory Defragmentation for Large-scale DNN Training with Virtual Memory Stitching,"Large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs), such as large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized the artificial intelligence (AI) field and become increasingly popular. However, training or fine-tuning such models requires substantial computational power and resources, where the memory capacity of a single acceleration device like a GPU is one of the most important bottlenecks. Owing to the prohibitively large overhead (e.g., 10) of GPUs' native memory allocator, DNN frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow adopt a caching allocator that maintains a memory pool with a splitting mechanism for fast memory (de)allocation. Unfortunately, the caching allocator's efficiency degrades quickly for popular memory reduction techniques such as re-computation, offloading, distributed training, and low-rank adaptation. The primary reason is that those memory reduction techniques introduce frequent and irregular memory (de)allocation requests, leading to severe fragmentation problems for the splitting-based caching allocator. To mitigate this fragmentation problem, we propose a novel memory allocation framework based on low-level GPU virtual memory management called GPU memory lake (GMLake). GMLake employs a novel virtual memory stitching (VMS) mechanism, which can fuse or combine non-contiguous memory blocks with a virtual memory address mapping. GMLake can reduce average of 9.2 GB (up to 25 GB) GPU memory usage and 15% (up to 33%) fragmentation among eight LLM models on GPU A100 with 80 GB memory. GMLake is completely transparent to the DNN models and memory reduction techniques and ensures the seamless execution of resource-intensive deep-learning tasks. We have open-sourced GMLake at https://github.com/intelligent-machine-learning/glake/tree/main/GMLake.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3620665.3640423,3,,,,,,,Cong Guo and Rui Zhang and Jiale Xu and Jingwen Leng and Zihan Liu and Ziyu Huang and Minyi Guo and Hao Wu and Shouren Zhao and Junping Zhao and Ke Zhang,10.1145/3620665.3640423,,,,"GPU,deep learning,memory defragmentation,virtual memory stitching",,,450-466,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3620665.3640423,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1673,inproceedings,BiasAsker: Measuring the Bias in Conversational AI System,"Powered by advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, conversational AI systems, such as ChatGPT, and digital assistants like Siri, have been widely deployed in daily life. However, such systems may still produce content containing biases and stereotypes, causing potential social problems. Due to modern AI techniques’ data-driven, black-box nature, comprehensively identifying and measuring biases in conversational systems remains challenging. Particularly, it is hard to generate inputs that can comprehensively trigger potential bias due to the lack of data containing both social groups and biased properties. In addition, modern conversational systems can produce diverse responses (e.g., chatting and explanation), which makes existing bias detection methods based solely on sentiment and toxicity hardly being adopted. In this paper, we propose BiasAsker, an automated framework to identify and measure social bias in conversational AI systems. To obtain social groups and biased properties, we construct a comprehensive social bias dataset containing a total of 841 groups and 5,021 biased properties. Given the dataset, BiasAsker automatically generates questions and adopts a novel method based on existence measurement to identify two types of biases (i.e., absolute bias and related bias) in conversational systems. Extensive experiments on eight commercial systems and two famous research models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-3, show that 32.83% of the questions generated by BiasAsker can trigger biased behaviors in these widely deployed conversational systems.

ID-1674,article,Cloud-based Collaborative Agricultural Learning with Flexible Model Size and Adaptive Batch Number,"With the rapid growth in the world population, developing agricultural technologies has been an urgent need. Sensor networks have been widely used to monitor and manage agricultural status. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are adopted for their high accuracy to enable the analysis of massive data collected through the sensor network. The datasets on the devices of agricultural applications usually need to be completed and bigger, which limits the performance of AI algorithms. Thus, researchers turn to Collaborative Learning (CL) to utilize the data on multiple devices to train a global model privately. However, current CL frameworks for agricultural applications suffer from three problems: data heterogeneity, system heterogeneity, and communication overhead. In this paper, we propose cloud-based Collaborative Agricultural Learning with Flexible model size and Adaptive batch number (CALFA) to improve the efficiency and applicability of the training process while maintaining its effectiveness. CALFA contains three modules. The Classification Pyramid allows the devices to use different sizes of models during training and enables the classification of different object sizes. Adaptive Aggregation modifies the aggregation weights to maintain the convergence speed and accuracy. Adaptive Adjustment modifies the training batch numbers to mitigate the communication overhead. The experimental results illustrate that CALFA outperforms other SOTA CL frameworks by reducing up to 75% communication overhead with nearly no accuracy loss. Also, CALFA enables training on more devices by reducing the model size.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3628431,3,,,,,,,Hongjian Shi and Ilyas Bayanbayev and Wenkai Zheng and Ruhui Ma and Haibing Guan,10.1145/3628431,1550-4859,,ACM Trans.

ID-1677,inproceedings,Quality Diversity Evolutionary Learning of Decision Trees,"Addressing the need for explainable Machine Learning has emerged as one of the most important research directions in modern Artificial Intelligence (AI). While the current dominant paradigm in the field is based on black-box models, typically in the form of (deep) neural networks, these models lack direct interpretability for human users, i.e., their outcomes (and, even more so, their inner working) are opaque and hard to understand. This is hindering the adoption of AI in safety-critical applications, where high interests are at stake. In these applications, explainable by design models, such as decision trees, may be more suitable, as they provide interpretability. Recent works have proposed the hybridization of decision trees and Reinforcement Learning, to combine the advantages of the two approaches. So far, however, these works have focused on the optimization of those hybrid models. Here, we apply MAP-Elites for diversifying hybrid models over a feature space that captures both the model complexity and its behavioral variability. We apply our method on two well-known control problems from the OpenAI Gym library, on which we discuss the ""illumination"" patterns projected by MAP-Elites, comparing its results against existing similar approaches.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3555776.3577591,3,,,,,,,Andrea Ferigo and Leonardo Lucio Custode and Giovanni Iacca,10.1145/3555776.3577591,,,,"decision trees,explainability,grammatical evolution,quality diversity,reinforcement learning",,,425-432,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3555776.3577591,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1678,inproceedings,The ethical ambiguity of AI data enrichment: Measuring gaps in research ethics norms and practices,"The technical progression of artificial intelligence (AI) research has been built on breakthroughs in fields such as computer science, statistics, and mathematics. However, in the past decade AI researchers have increasingly looked to the social sciences, turning to human interactions to solve the challenges of model development. Paying crowdsourcing workers to generate or curate data, or ‘data enrichment’, has become indispensable for many areas of AI research, from natural language processing to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Other fields that routinely interact with crowdsourcing workers, such as Psychology, have developed common governance requirements and norms to ensure research is undertaken ethically. This study explores how, and to what extent, comparable research ethics requirements and norms have developed for AI research and data enrichment. We focus on the approach taken by two leading conferences: ICLR and NeurIPS, and journal publisher Springer. In a longitudinal study of accepted papers, and via a comparison with Psychology and CHI papers, this work finds that leading AI venues have begun to establish protocols for human data collection, but these are are inconsistently followed by authors. Whilst Psychology papers engaging with crowdsourcing workers frequently disclose ethics reviews, payment data, demographic data and other information, similar disclosures are far less common in leading AI venues despite similar guidance.

ID-1680,inproceedings,"Regulating the machine: An exploratory study of US state legislations addressing Artificial Intelligence, 2019-2023","Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses transformative and disruptive challenges for democracy, for policy makers, and for government agencies. While various policy initiatives around the world seek to regulate AI, in the United States (US) federal government there is no sign of a comprehensive AI law, and few legal measures to enable or restrict AI have been proposed and passed. However, states across the US are active in attempting to address issues related to AI and have proposed hundreds of legislations related to AI in the past few years. In this paper, we examined what these legislations have sought to accomplish in relation to AI, and the potential impacts for the public in general and for public administration in particular. From a preliminary and descriptive analysis of all US state legislations related to AI passed from 2019 to 2023, we show how these legislations are addressing AI in terms of: (1) the types of legislations adopted or enacted; (2) the definitions of AI and associated technologies given; (3) the sectors and domains principally addressed in AI legislations; (4) the private sector and government actions directed by the legislations; and (5) how ethical and economic considerations are addressed. We generally found a lack of definition of AI, and associated technologies mentioned are rarely specific. Many of the laws create commissions or task forces to study AI, addressing the various practical and ethical issues related to AI. Legislations have created some regulations and support for industry, and have directed government agencies to identify existing AI capabilities and how AI may be employed in their agencies and jurisdictions.

ID-1681,inproceedings,User Involvement in Training Smart Home Agents: Increasing Perceived Control and Understanding,"Smart home systems contain plenty of features that enhance wellbeing in everyday life through artificial intelligence (AI). However, many users feel insecure because they do not understand the AI’s functionality and do not feel they are in control of it. Combining technical, psychological and philosophical views on AI, we rethink smart homes as interactive systems where users can partake in an intelligent agent’s learning. Parallel to the goals of explainable AI (XAI), we explored the possibility of user involvement in supervised learning of the smart home to have a first approach to improve acceptance, support subjective understanding and increase perceived control. In this work, we conducted two studies: In an online pre-study, we asked participants about their attitude towards teaching AI via a questionnaire. In the main study, we performed a Wizard of Oz laboratory experiment with human participants, where participants spent time in a prototypical smart home and taught activity recognition to the intelligent agent through supervised learning based on the user’s behaviour. We found that involvement in the AI’s learning phase enhanced the users’ feeling of control, perceived understanding and perceived usefulness of AI in general. The participants reported positive attitudes towards training a smart home AI and found the process understandable and controllable. We suggest that involving the user in the learning phase could lead to better personalisation and increased understanding and control by users of intelligent agents for smart home automation.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3527188.3561914,3,,,,,,,Leonie Nora Sieger and Julia Hermann and Astrid Schomäcker and Stefan Heindorf and Christian Meske and Celine-Chiara Hey and Ayşegül Doğangün,10.1145/3527188.3561914,,,,"human-agent interaction,participation,smart homes,supervised learning",,,76-85,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3527188.3561914,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1682,article,How Engineers’ Imaginaries of Healthcare Shape Design and User Engagement: A Case Study of a Robotics Initiative for Geriatric Healthcare AI Applications,"In the development of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare, human-centered approaches seek to meet the requirements of healthcare practice and address social and ethical aspects proactively. In this work, an important but neglected aspect of human-computer interaction (HCI) is how engineers understand and envision the healthcare context. Drawing on insights from STS on engineers’ imaginaries and their role in shaping research and development of new technologies, we propose engineers’ imaginaries of healthcare as a point of analysis and intervention for ethical and social aspects of AI and robotics for healthcare. To illustrate the utility of this lens, we use it to on report a case study of an engineering project that develops robotic and AI applications for healthcare. We followed and sought to advance an embedded ethics and social science approach, where ethicists and social scientists accompanied this engineering project using direct interdisciplinary collaboration, observations, and in-depth qualitative interviews with the project’s engineers (n = 18). We analyze how the engineers imagine healthcare as an environment for robots, healthcare workers as potential users, and healthcare practices, and how these imaginaries connect to the design narratives that guide their work. Our findings provide pertinent input for HCI, STS, and engineering ethics related to healthcare AI and robotics, as they speak to prevalent narratives of “assistance” systems, aspects of how human healthcare practices are reframed and valued in the face of new technologies, questions of division of labor between machines and healthcare practitioners, and the implications of ‘acceptance’ as a frame for user-centered design.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3577010,3,,,,,,,Svenja Breuer and Maximilian Braun and Daniel Tigard and Alena Buyx and Ruth Müller,10.1145/3577010,1073-0516,2,ACM Trans.

ID-1684,inproceedings,Dynamic Intrusion Detection Framework for UAVCAN Protocol Using AI,"Industry 4.0 is going through a transitional period via the radically automotive transformations. In particular, unmanned aerial vehicles have significantly contributed to the development of intelligent and connected transportation systems. Thus, the continuous development using diverse technologies to achieve a variety of high-performance services raised the security concerns regarding communicating entities. Thus, being managed by networked controllers, UAVs uses controller area networks (CAN) protocol to broadcast information in a bus. However, this protocol is used as a de facto standard which does not have sufficient security features that raise the security risks. This issue caught the attention of the automotive industry researchers and several studies have attempted to improve the security of the CAN protocol attack detection. However, the proposed studies established general perspective solution and did not pay attention to UAVCAN attack detection. To alleviate these concerns, this paper proposed a dynamic intrusion detection frameworks (DIDF) for UAVCAN. The proposed UAVCAN DIDF scheme adopts an artificial intelligence (AI) based model to achieve high detection performance. We performed experiments using public UAVCAN dataset to evaluate our detection system. The experimental results demonstrate that UAVCAN DIDF has significantly reached a high detection rate with a high true positive and a low false negative rate. The simulation results are encouraging and demonstrate the effectiveness of UAVCAN DIDF.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3600160.3605071,3,,,,,,,Fadhila Tlili and Samiha Ayed and Lamia CHAARI FOURATI,10.1145/3600160.3605071,,,,"Artificial Intelligence.,Industry 4.0,Intrusion Detection,Security,UAVCAN,UAVs",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3600160.3605071,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1686,inproceedings,A multidomain relational framework to guide institutional AI research and adoption,"Calls for new metrics, technical standards and governance mechanisms to guide the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in institutions and public administration are now commonplace. Yet, most research and policy efforts aimed at understanding the implications of adopting AI tend to prioritize only a handful of ideas; they do not fully connect all the different perspectives and topics that are potentially relevant. In this position paper, we contend that this omission stems, in part, from what we call the ‘relational problem’ in socio-technical discourse: fundamental ontological issues have not yet been settled—including semantic ambiguity, a lack of clear relations between concepts and differing standard terminologies. This contributes to the persistence of disparate modes of reasoning to assess institutional AI systems, and the prevalence of conceptual isolation in the fields that study them including ML, human factors, social science and policy. After developing this critique, we offer a way forward by proposing a simple policy and research design tool in the form of a conceptual framework to organize terms across fields—consisting of three horizontal domains for grouping relevant concepts and related methods: Operational, Epistemic, and Normative. We first situate this framework against the backdrop of recent socio-technical discourse at two premier academic venues, AIES and FAccT, before illustrating how developing suitable metrics, standards, and mechanisms can be aided by operationalizing relevant concepts in each of these domains. Finally, we outline outstanding questions for developing this relational approach to institutional AI research and adoption.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3600211.3604718,3,,,,,,,Vincent J Straub and Deborah Morgan and Youmna Hashem and John Francis and Saba Esnaashari and Jonathan Bright,10.1145/3600211.3604718,,,,"AIES,Conceptual framework,FAccT,Institutions,Public Administration,Socio-Technical Discourse",,,512-519,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3600211.3604718,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

In order to properly specify the autonomous decision-making of fighter, hence, we proposed a unified framework which combines the combat simulation and machine learning in this paper. This framework adopts deep reinforcement learning modelling by using the supervised learning and the Deep Q-Network (DQN) methods.

New ML models have led to the adoption of AI in different disciplines. The development of the most recent large language models has created so much interest that it might mean a revolution in using of AI. Some make a stronger claim that it is a turning point in human civilization's history, and we have started the AI age after replacing the obsolete in many aspects of Information Age applications. One of the immediate challenges is how to use AI and ML responsibly with proper protection for humans and human society. In this paper, we report on our efforts in introducing trustworthiness of ML in college curricula and what factors influence AI-supported decision making. The main goal is to allow students to gain an understanding not only of concepts but also of the limitations of AI. This will help in their participation in our society of the AI Age.

ID-1690,inproceedings,Application of K-means clustering based on artificial intelligence in gene statistics of biological information engineering,"In the field of bioinformatics, the algorithm of biological gene sequence has always been one of the hot problems in scientific research. With the combination of biology and artificial intelligence technology, genetic algorithm data is increasing. At the same time, the emergence of a new generation of sequencing technology, the decrease in sequencing time and cost, and the high sequencing throughput have significantly increased the sequence data, showing an exponential growth trend, and there are still new biological gene sequence data found and recorded every day, and the speed of data generation is much faster than the speed of data processing, so the processing of large-scale DNA sequencing data needs more efficient methods. Therefore, AI bioinformatics engineering, especially genetic algorithms and K-means cluster analysis, has become an important tool in the field of bioinformatics statistics, with particular impact on the detection and diagnosis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) associated with contact dermatitis. These advanced AI models efficiently process large amounts of genomic data, including SNP datasets, and have the ability to analyze patient genotype information. By doing so, they can identify SNPS that are strongly associated with contact dermatitis and establish meaningful associations between these genetic variants and the disease.The adoption of this personalized medicine approach not only addresses the specific needs of individual patients but also significantly enhances the success rate of treatment.

Contrary to the European AI Act, which is valid for all companies and organizations in Europe, and contrary to the Chinese administrative rule on Internet information recommender systems, the Schleswig-Holstein “IT Deployment Law” (ITDL) would therefore only apply to public administrations and agencies in the federal state.

ID-1692,inproceedings,A Framework for Monte-Carlo Tree Search on CPU-FPGA Heterogeneous Platform via on-chip Dynamic Tree Management,"Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a widely used search technique in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. MCTS manages a dynamically evolving decision tree (i.e., one whose depth and height evolve at run-time) to guide an AI agent toward an optimal policy. In-tree operations are memory-bound leading to a critical performance bottleneck for large-scale parallel MCTS on general-purpose processors. CPU-FPGA accelerators can alleviate the memory bottleneck of in-tree operations. However, a major challenge for existing FPGA accelerators is the lack of dynamic memory management due to which they cannot efficiently support dynamically evolving MCTS trees. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing an MCTS acceleration framework that (1) incorporates an algorithm-hardware co-optimized accelerator design that supports in-tree operations on dynamically evolving trees without expensive hardware reconfiguration; (2) adopts a hybrid parallel execution model to fully exploit the compute power in a CPU-FPGA heterogeneous system; (3) supports Python-based programming API for easy integration of the proposed accelerator with RL domain-specific bench-marking libraries at run-time. We show that by using our framework, we achieve up to 6.8 speedup and superior scalability of parallel workers than state-of-the-art parallel MCTS on multi-core systems.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3543622.3573177,3,,,,,,,Yuan Meng and Rajgopal Kannan and Viktor Prasanna,10.1145/3543622.3573177,,,,"ai acceleration,heterogeneous computing,mcts,reinforcement learning",,,235-245,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3543622.3573177,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

For example, through the generation of more accurate medical diagnoses to support patients’ treatment, more content personalization to provide adaptive learning for students and more accurate predictions for future climate changes. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for professionals from different fields with AI competencies. These future professionals need preparation during their undergraduate education to deal with the remarkable AI breakthroughs in their domains and to understand, use, and help with the responsible development of these technologies. However, to address AI to non-computer science students in undergraduate education, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the core AI competencies essential to these students acquire in order to prepare them effectively. Based on this, the objective of the research is to develop a framework with core AI competencies that can be adopted in future work to inform AI education for this target audience. Therefore, towards the AI competency framework for non-computer science students in undergraduate education, as an initial part of the process, we conducted semi-structured interviews with professionals working in the intersection of AI and other domains. The objective of the interviews was to qualitatively investigate the AI competencies considered suitable for incorporation into the undergraduate education curricula of non-computer science students from these professionals’ points of view. In this work, we present the results of these interviews and the list of core AI competencies for non-computer science students in undergraduate education according to these professionals.

This paper focuses on providing examples of improper design and usage of AI from practice, with regards to a selection of human values. In total, 54 examples were identified using a narrative literature search technique regarding seven human values selected. In conclusion, the examples show that the problems regarding the design and execution can be interrelated but do not have to be.

ID-1696,inproceedings,Exploring Architectural Choices and Emerging Challenges in Data Management for IoT: A Focus on Digital Innovation and Smart Cities,"Digital innovation is an important and evolving process that refers to the transformation and integration of digital technologies into various aspects of everyday life and work. In this context, innovative digital solutions are often adopted and developed, including the Internet of Things (IoT). In order to fully understand the potential, trends, and challenges related to the implementation of these technologies in data management, we seek to identify the most promising architectural choices for an IoT infrastructure from the perspective of key aspects in the context of Data Management. In this way, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of IoT systems to guide organizations towards more informed decisions, offering cutting-edge solutions and contributing to digital transformation. This work aims to examine aspects such as Data Collection, Data Aggregation, Data Integration, Data Security, Data Retention, and Data Analysis, with particular attention to emerging challenges in these contexts. Within the context of digital innovation, our study focuses on several areas of interest. For example, in the field of smart cities, we explore how the use of Cloud, Fog, and Edge Computing technologies can improve video surveillance and promote the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for better management of smart cities. Cloud computing, characterized by centralized data processing and storage, represents a well established paradigm of IoT infrastructure. Fog computing extends these capabilities to the network edge, bringing computation and data storage closer to the data source, thereby reducing latency and enhancing real-time processing. Edge computing takes this concept further by processing data directly at or near the data source, minimizing the need for data to traverse long distances to centralized hubs, thus enabling even faster response times and improved efficiency. Additionally, we examine how human-centric methods and user modeling tools can facilitate the transition to intelligent environments, such as workplaces, healthcare, and cities. Considering the emerging challenges in IoT data management, our work provides an overview of the solutions offered by Cloud, Fog, and Edge Computing, enabling industries and small and medium-sized enterprises to adopt targeted and sustainable digital transformation strategies.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3631700.3665238,3,,,,,,,Silvio Barra and Ferdinando D'Alessandro and Oleksandr Sosovskyy,10.1145/3631700.3665238,,,,,,,429-436,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3631700.3665238,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1697,article,Enabling AI at the edge with XNOR-networks,"In recent years we have seen a growing number of edge devices adopted by consumers, in their homes (e.g., smart cameras and doorbells), in their cars (e.g., driver assisted systems), and even on their persons (e.g., smart watches and rings). Similar growth is reported in industries including aerospace, agriculture, healthcare, transport, and manufacturing. At the same time that devices are getting smaller, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that power most forms of artificial intelligence are getting larger, requiring more compute power, memory, and bandwidth. This creates a growing disconnect between advances in artificial intelligence and the ability to develop smart devices at the edge. In this paper, we present a novel approach to running state-of-the-art AI algorithms at the edge. We propose two efficient approximations to standard convolutional neural networks: Binary-Weight-Networks (BWN) and XNOR-Networks. In BWN, the filters are approximated with binary values resulting in 32x memory saving. In XNOR-Networks, both the filters and the input to convolutional layers are binary. XNOR-Networks approximate convolutions using primarily binary operations. This results in 58x faster convolutional operations (in terms of number of the high precision operations) and 32x memory savings. XNOR-Nets offer the possibility of running state-of-the-art networks on CPUs (rather than GPUs) in real-time. Our binary networks are simple, accurate, efficient, and work on challenging visual tasks. We evaluate our approach on the ImageNet classification task. The classification accuracy with a BWN version of AlexNet is the same as the full-precision AlexNet.

The project investigates the use of a purpose-built citizen science application that engages Indigenous youth in educational exercises rooted in local cultural heritage, specifically rock art, making learning more engaging and exposing them to digital technologies. Furthermore, ML models trained with the data gathered through these educational activities can then assist with classifying new rock art images and assisting rangers and archaeologists with site archiving and conservation efforts. This paper discusses the project's significance in enhancing Indigenous science and technology education and outlines its results in utilising ML for rock art classification. Adopting deep learning in rock art classification offers a compelling avenue for the automated analysis and interpretation of heritage objects and places. However, training deep neural networks from scratch often requires enormous datasets and computational resources, posing challenges for domain-specific applications with smaller datasets. With a dataset comprising approximately 3,100 labelled rock art images, we evaluated various tools within the transfer learning toolbox using three prominent pre-trained architectures: VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNet V2 S. Through the collaborative efforts of Indigenous students and ML, we demonstrate that even with limited training resources, using transfer learning to re-purpose an existing model can achieve motif classification Top-1 accuracy of 79.76% and Top-5 of 94.56%. The project ran from 2021 to 2023, including three week-long sessions with students of Laura State School to trial the citizen science app and the evaluation, development and refinement of the ML models.The DDP project not only serves as a beacon for community-centric research but also forges a new frontier in integrating Indigenous cultural heritage with modern technology. The impact reaches beyond academia, directly enriching the educational experience for Indigenous students in Laura and equipping local rangers and archaeologists with advanced tools for rock art conservation.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3665796,3,,,,,,,Richard Turner-Jones and Gervase Tuxworth and Robert Haubt and Lynley A Wallis,10.1145/3665796,1556-4673,,J.

ID-1699,inproceedings,DStore: A Lightweight Scalable Learning Model Repository with Fine-Grain Tensor-Level Access,"The ability to share and reuse deep learning (DL) models is a key driver that facilitates the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in both industrial and scientific applications. However, state-of-the-art approaches to store and access DL models efficiently at scale lag behind. Most often, DL models are serialized by using various formats (e.g., HDF5, SavedModel) and stored as files on POSIX file systems. While simple and portable, such an approach exhibits high serialization and I/O overheads, especially under concurrency. Additionally, the emergence of advanced AI techniques (transfer learning, sensitivity analysis, explainability, etc.) introduces the need for fine-grained access to tensors to facilitate the extraction and reuse of individual or subsets of tensors. Such patterns are underserved by state-of-the-art approaches. Requiring tensors to be read in bulk incurs suboptimal performance, scales poorly, and/or overutilizes network bandwidth. In this paper we propose a lightweight, distributed, RDMA-enabled learning model repository that addresses these challenges. Specifically we introduce several ideas: compact architecture graph representation with stable hashing and client-side metadata caching, scalable load balancing on multiple providers, RDMA-optimized data staging, and direct access to raw tensor data. We evaluate our proposal in extensive experiments that involve different access patterns using learning models of diverse shapes and sizes. Our evaluations show a significant improvement (between 2 and 30 over a variety of state-of-the-art model storage approaches while scaling to half the Cooley cluster at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3577193.3593730,3,,,,,,,Meghana Madhyastha and Robert Underwood and Randal Burns and Bogdan Nicolae,10.1145/3577193.3593730,,,,"DL model repository,benchmarking,fine-grained tensor storage and access",,,133-143,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3577193.3593730,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1701,inproceedings,"Explainability in AI Policies: A Critical Review of Communications, Reports, Regulations, and Standards in the EU, US, and UK","Public attention towards explainability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has been rising in recent years to offer methodologies for human oversight. This has translated into the proliferation of research outputs, such as from Explainable AI, to enhance transparency and control for system debugging and monitoring, and intelligibility of system process and output for user services. Yet, such outputs are difficult to adopt on a practical level due to a lack of a common regulatory baseline, and the contextual nature of explanations. Governmental policies are now attempting to tackle such exigence, however it remains unclear to what extent published communications, regulations, and standards adopt an informed perspective to support research, industry, and civil interests. In this study, we perform the first thematic and gap analysis of this plethora of policies and standards on explainability in the EU, US, and UK. Through a rigorous survey of policy documents, we first contribute an overview of governmental regulatory trajectories within AI explainability and its sociotechnical impacts. We find that policies are often informed by coarse notions and requirements for explanations. This might be due to the willingness to conciliate explanations foremost as a risk management tool for AI oversight, but also due to the lack of a consensus on what constitutes a valid algorithmic explanation, and how feasible the implementation and deployment of such explanations are across stakeholders of an organization. Informed by AI explainability research, we then conduct a gap analysis of existing policies, which leads us to formulate a set of recommendations on how to address explainability in regulations for AI systems, especially discussing the definition, feasibility, and usability of explanations, as well as allocating accountability to explanation providers.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3593013.3594074,3,,,,,,,Luca Nannini and Agathe Balayn and Adam Leon Smith,10.1145/3593013.3594074,,,,"AI policy,Explainable AI,social epistemology",,,1198-1212,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3593013.3594074,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

Some recent advances in XAI are based on Evolutionary Computation (EC) techniques, such as Genetic Programming. We call this trend EC for XAI. We argue that the full potential of EC methods has not been fully exploited yet in XAI, and call the community for future efforts in this field. Likewise, we find that there is a growing concern in EC regarding the explanation of population-based methods, i.e., their search process and outcomes. While some attempts have been done in this direction (although, in most cases, those are not explicitly put in the context of XAI), we believe that there are still several research opportunities and open research questions that, in principle, may promote a safer and broader adoption of EC in real-world applications. We call this trend XAI within EC. In this position paper, we briefly overview the main results in the two above trends, and suggest that the EC community may play a major role in the achievement of XAI.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3520304.3533974,3,,,,,,,Jaume Bacardit and Alexander E I Brownlee and Stefano Cagnoni and Giovanni Iacca and John McCall and David Walker,10.1145/3520304.3533974,,,,"evolutionary computation,explainable artificial intelligence,machine learning,optimization",,,1757-1762,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3520304.3533974,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1703,inproceedings,Do Humans Prefer Debiased AI Algorithms? A Case Study in Career Recommendation,"Currently, there is a surge of interest in fair Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research which aims to mitigate discriminatory bias in AI algorithms, e.g. along lines of gender, age, and race. While most research in this domain focuses on developing fair AI algorithms, in this work, we examine the challenges which arise when human- fair-AI interact. Our results show that due to an apparent conflict between human preferences and fairness, a fair AI algorithm on its own may be insufficient to achieve its intended results in the real world. Using college major recommendation as a case study, we build a fair AI recommender by employing gender debiasing machine learning techniques. Our offline evaluation showed that the debiased recommender makes fairer and more accurate college major recommendations. Nevertheless, an online user study of more than 200 college students revealed that participants on average prefer the original biased system over the debiased system. Specifically, we found that the perceived gender disparity associated with a college major is a determining factor for the acceptance of a recommendation. In other words, our results demonstrate we cannot fully address the gender bias issue in AI recommendations without addressing the gender bias in humans. They also highlight the urgent need to extend the current scope of fair AI research from narrowly focusing on debiasing AI algorithms to including new persuasion and bias explanation technologies in order to achieve intended societal impacts.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3490099.3511108,1,1,1,,,,,Clarice Wang and Kathryn Wang and Andrew Bian and Rashidul Islam and Kamrun Naher Keya and James Foulds and Shimei Pan,10.1145/3490099.3511108,,,,,,,134-147,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3490099.3511108,2022,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1705,inproceedings,"Performance, Trust, or both? COVID-19 Diagnosis and Prognosis using Deep Ensemble Transfer Learning on X-ray Images✱","The COVID-19 pandemic still affects most parts of the world today. Despite a lot of research on diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, a big challenge today is the limited number of expert radiologists who provide diagnosis and prognosis on X-Ray images. Thus, to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 accessible and quicker, several researchers have proposed deep-learning-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. While most of these proposed machine and deep learning models work in theory, they may not find acceptance among the medical community for clinical use due to weak statistical validation. For this article, radiologists’ views were considered to understand the correlation between the theoretical findings and real-life observations. The article explores Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification models to build a four-class viz. ""COVID-19"", ""Lung Opacity"", ""Pneumonia"", and ""Normal"" classifiers, which also provide the uncertainty measure associated with each class. The authors also employ various pre-processing techniques to enhance the X-Ray images for specific features. To address the issues of over-fitting while training, as well as to address the class imbalance problem in our dataset, we use Monte Carlo dropout and Focal Loss respectively. Finally, we provide a comparative analysis of the following classification models - ResNet-18, VGG-19, ResNet-152, MobileNet-V2, Inception-V3, and EfficientNet-V2, where we match the state-of-the-art results on the Open Benchmark Chest X-ray datasets, with a sensitivity of 0.9954, specificity of 0.9886, the precision of 0.9880, F1-score of 0.9851, accuracy of 0.9816, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9781 (ROC-AUC score).",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3571600.3571609,3,,,,,,,Abhishek Tiwari and Rajeev Kumar Singh,10.1145/3571600.3571609,,,,"COVID-19,Chest X-ray,Classification,Deep Ensemble Transfer Learning,Pneumonia,SARS-CoV-2.",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3571600.3571609,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

One relevant application area for AI is using speech recognition to create subtitles and closed captions for videos. The AI methods based on machine learning are still not sufficiently reliable in terms of producing perfect or acceptable subtitles. To compensate for this unreliability, AI can be used to build tools that support, rather than replace, human efforts and to create semi-automated workflows. In this paper, we present a prototype for including automated speech recognition for subtitling in an existing production-grade video editing tool. We devised an experiment with 25 participants and tested the efficiency and effectiveness of this tool compared to a fully manual process. The results show that there is a significant increase in both effectiveness and efficiency for novices in subtitling. Furthermore, the participants found the augmented process to be more demanding.

ID-1708,inproceedings,A Principled Decomposition of Pointwise Mutual Information for Intention Template Discovery,"With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), question answering systems have become common for users to interact with computers, e.g., ChatGPT and Siri. These systems require a substantial amount of labeled data to train their models. However, the labeled data is scarce and challenging to be constructed. The construction process typically involves two stages: discovering potential sample candidates and manually labeling these candidates. To discover high-quality candidate samples, we study the intention paraphrase template discovery task: Given some seed questions or templates of an intention, discover new paraphrase templates that describe the intention and are diverse to the seeds enough in text. As the first exploration of the task, we identify the new quality requirements, i.e., relevance, divergence and popularity, and identify the new challenges, i.e., the paradox of divergent yet relevant paraphrases, and the conflict of popular yet relevant paraphrases. To untangle the paradox of divergent yet relevant paraphrases, in which the traditional bag of words falls short, we develop usage-centric modeling, which represents a question/template/answer as a bag of usages that users engaged (e.g., up-votes), and uses a usage-flow graph to interrelate templates, questions and answers. To balance the conflict of popular yet relevant paraphrases, we propose a new and principled decomposition for the well-known Pointwise Mutual Information from the usage perspective (usage-PMI), and then develop a Bayesian inference framework over the usage-flow graph to estimate the usage-PMI. Extensive experiments over three large CQA corpora show strong performance advantage over the baselines adopted from paraphrase identification task. We release 885,000 paraphrase templates of high quality discovered by our proposed PMI decomposition model, and the data is available in site https://github.com/Para-Questions/Intention_template_discovery.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3583780.3614767,3,,,,,,,Denghao Ma and Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang and Yueguo Chen and Xueqiang Lv and Liang Shen,10.1145/3583780.3614767,,,,"Bayesian inference,paraphrasing,pointwise mutual information",,,1746-1755,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3583780.3614767,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

Such interventions recommend that companies building and using AI tools change their technical practices, but fail to wrangle with critical questions about the organizational and institutional context in which AI is developed. In this paper, we contribute descriptive research around the life of ""AI"" as a discursive concept and organizational practice in an understudied sphere–emerging AI startups–and with a focus on extra-organizational pressures faced by entrepreneurs. Leveraging a theoretical lens for how organizations change, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 entrepreneurs working at early-stage AI startups. We find that actors within startups both conform to and resist institutional pressures. Our analysis identifies a central tension for AI entrepreneurs: they often valued scientific integrity and methodological rigor; however, influential external stakeholders either lacked the technical knowledge to appreciate entrepreneurs' emphasis on rigor or were more focused on business priorities. As a result, entrepreneurs adopted hyped marketing messages about AI that diverged from their scientific values, but attempted to preserve their legitimacy internally. Institutional pressures and organizational constraints also influenced entrepreneurs' modeling practices and their response to actual or impending regulation. We conclude with a discussion for how such pressures could be used as leverage for effective interventions towards building ethical AI.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3514094.3534138,3,,,,,,,Amy A Winecoff and Elizabeth Anne Watkins,10.1145/3514094.3534138,,,,"artificial intelligence,ethical systems,industry practice,organizational theory,qualitative methods",,,788-799,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3514094.3534138,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1710,inproceedings,Using the Concept of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to Strengthen the Classification Performance for X-ray Images of Small Samples,"Because the medical technology is quickly developed, how to implement an accurate diagnosis and adopts timely treatment that will seriously influence the patient safety. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the medical diagnosis support system (MDSS) also plays key role and to increase the diagnostic performance. However, there is a problem that needs to be noted and solved for the MDSS in machine and deep learning. That is, when the data exhibits an imbalance situation and the lack of sufficient medical diagnosis data that will induce an inferior recognition result. Based on such a problem, the main purpose of this study is to construct a classification system so that the abnormal images of chest x-ray in small samples can be distinguished smoothly for pneumothorax. Firstly, the classified system uses the cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to learn the image features, and then forms the virtual pneumothorax images so as to raise the abnormal samples. When the virtual samples are generated completely, the system will apply the convolutional neural network (CNN) model to execute the training and discriminating tasks. Using the expanded sample cluster, the system can perform the training procedure and the real testing data is also used to evaluate the classified accuracy. The experiment studies showed that the expanded classification system is able to obtain a superior performance than the simple CNN classifier. At last, an experimental case for pneumothorax is used to illustrate the proposed system for verifying the feasibility of using our analysis procedure.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3608298.3608365,3,,,,,,,Chih-Hung Jen and Shu-Kai S Fan and Kun-Mu Lu and Ching-Wen Huang and Ju-Ling Hsiao and Yu-Zhi Zheng and Yi-Jun Cai,10.1145/3608298.3608365,,,,,,,297-302,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3608298.3608365,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1716,inproceedings,Error Resilient In-Memory Computing Architecture for CNN Inference on the Edge,"The growing popularity of edge computing has fostered the development of diverse solutions to support Artificial Intelligence (AI) in energy-constrained devices. Nonetheless, comparatively few efforts have focused on the resiliency exhibited by AI workloads (such as Convolutional Neural Networks, CNNs) as an avenue towards increasing their run-time efficiency, and even fewer have proposed strategies to increase such resiliency. We herein address this challenge in the context of Bit-line Computing architectures, an embodiment of the in-memory computing paradigm tailored towards CNN applications. We show that little additional hardware is required to add highly effective error detection and mitigation in such platforms. In turn, our proposed scheme can cope with high error rates when performing memory accesses with no impact on CNNs accuracy, allowing for very aggressive voltage scaling. Complementary, we also show that CNN resiliency can be increased by algorithmic optimizations in addition to architectural ones, adopting a combined ensembling and pruning strategy that increases robustness while not inflating workload requirements. Experiments on different quantized CNN models reveal that our combined hardware/software approach enables the supply voltage to be reduced to just 650mV, decreasing the energy per inference up to 51.3%, without affecting the baseline CNN classification accuracy.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3526241.3530351,3,,,,,,,Marco Rios and Flavio Ponzina and Giovanni Ansaloni and Alexandre Levisse and David Atienza,10.1145/3526241.3530351,,,,"deep neural networks,fault tolerant architectures,in-memory computing",,,249-254,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3526241.3530351,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1717,inproceedings,Toward A Two-Sided Fairness Framework in Search and Recommendation,"As artificial intelligence (AI) assisted search and recommender systems have become ubiquitous in workplaces and everyday lives, understanding and accounting for fairness has gained increasing attention in the design and evaluation of such systems. While there is a growing body of computing research on measuring system fairness and biases associated with data and algorithms, the impact of human biases that go beyond traditional machine learning (ML) pipelines still remain understudied. In this Perspective Paper, we seek to develop a two-sided fairness framework that not only characterizes data and algorithmic biases, but also highlights the cognitive and perceptual biases that may exacerbate system biases and lead to unfair decisions. Within the framework, we also analyze the interactions between human and system biases in search and recommendation episodes. Built upon the two-sided framework, our research synthesizes intervention and intelligent nudging strategies applied in cognitive and algorithmic debiasing, and also proposes novel goals and measures for evaluating the performance of systems in addressing and proactively mitigating the risks associated with biases in data, algorithms, and bounded rationality. This paper uniquely integrates the insights regarding human biases and system biases into a cohesive framework and extends the concept of fairness from human-centered perspective. The extended fairness framework better reflects the challenges and opportunities in users’ interactions with search and recommender systems of varying modalities. Adopting the two-sided approach in information system design has the potential to enhancing both the effectiveness in online debiasing and the usefulness to boundedly rational users engaging in information-intensive decision-making.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3576840.3578332,3,,,,,,,Jiqun Liu,10.1145/3576840.3578332,,,,"Two-sided fairness,human bias,information retrieval,recommender system,system bias",,,236-246,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3576840.3578332,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1718,inproceedings,"When cyber-physical systems meet AI: a benchmark, an evaluation, and a way forward","Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have been broadly deployed in safety-critical domains, such as automotive systems, avionics, medical devices, etc. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly adopted to control CPS. Despite the popularity of AI-enabled CPS, few benchmarks are publicly available. There is also a lack of deep understanding on the performance and reliability of AI-enabled CPS across different industrial domains. To bridge this gap, we present a public benchmark of industry-level CPS in seven domains and build AI controllers for them via state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. Based on that, we further perform a systematic evaluation of these AI-enabled systems with their traditional counterparts to identify current challenges and future opportunities. Our key findings include (1) AI controllers do not always outperform traditional controllers, (2) existing CPS testing techniques (falsification, specifically) fall short of analyzing AI-enabled CPS, and (3) building a hybrid system that strategically combines and switches between AI controllers and traditional controllers can achieve better performance across different domains. Our results highlight the need for new testing techniques for AI-enabled CPS and the need for more investigations into hybrid CPS to achieve optimal performance and reliability.

ID-1719,inproceedings,Towards trustworthy AI: safe-visor architecture for uncertified controllers in stochastic cyber-physical systems,"Artificial intelligence-based (a.k.a. AI-based) controllers have received significant attentions in the past few years due to their broad applications in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) to accomplish complex control missions. However, guaranteeing safety and reliability of CPSs equipped with this kind of (uncertified) controllers is currently very challenging, which is of vital importance in many real-life safety-critical applications. To cope with this difficulty, we propose a Safe-visor architecture for sandboxing AI-based controllers in stochastic CPSs. The proposed framework contains (i) a history-based supervisor which checks inputs from the AI-based controller and makes compromise between functionality and safety of the system, and (ii) a safety advisor that provides fallback when the AI-based controller endangers the safety of the system. By employing this architecture, we provide formal probabilistic guarantees on the satisfaction of those classes of safety specifications which can be represented by the accepting languages of deterministic finite automata (DFA), while AI-based controllers can still be employed in the control loop even though they are not reliable.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3457335.3461705,3,,,,,,,Abolfazl Lavaei and Bingzhuo Zhong and Marco Caccamo and Majid Zamani,10.1145/3457335.3461705,,,,"AI-based controllers,artificial intelligence,safe-visor architecture,stochastic cyber-physical systems,trustworthy AI",,,7-8,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3457335.3461705,2021,"New York, NY, USA",

However, AI has also raised serious privacy issues which hindered the adoption of the technology. Therefore, this research was an attempt to contribute towards attaining the goal of investigating the above problem in terms of students’ class engagement in various online learning contexts. A quantitative (quasi-experimental design) study with pre-test and post-test was conducted, and data were collected from 99 postgraduate students from the same local university in Hong Kong. The 99 students were divided into three groups randomly with each group consisting of 33 students. One control group learned with traditional online learning without any AI applications, two experimental groups learned with AI applications in the class, and one with the privacy issues taken into consideration. The pre-test and post-test were conducted based on The Online Student Engagement Scale (OSE) across 4 main factors (skills, emotion, participation, and performance) to assess the students’ behavioral changes. Descriptive analysis and ANCOVA analysis were used to analyze the data. This study discovered that the students’ online learning with the AI applications applied for 4 weeks improved their class engagement, and the group with privacy consent taken into consideration exhibited a greater improvement in students’ class engagement than the groups without privacy consent when implementing the AI application for online learning. The second stage of this project has been exploring the reasons behind the research results via a qualitative approach (interviews).

This paper addresses the prospects and obstacles associated with utilizing ChatGPT as a tool for learning and assessment in undergraduate Computer Science curriculum in particular to teaching and learning fundamental programming courses. Students having completed the course work for a Data Structures and Algorithms (a sophomore-level course) participated in this study. Two groups of students were given programming challenges to solve within a short period of time. The control group (group A) had access to textbooks and notes of programming courses, however, no Internet access was provided. Group B students were given access to ChatGPT and were encouraged to use it to help solve the programming challenges. The challenge was conducted in a computer lab environment using Programming Contest Control (PC2) environment which is widely used in ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Each team of students addresses the problem by writing executable code that satisfies a certain number of test cases. Student teams were scored based on their performance in terms of the number of successfully passed test cases. Results show that students using ChatGPT had an advantage in terms of earned scores, however, there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the submitted code consequently affecting the overall performance.

They not only build 10%-35% of our body tissues, but also can be used to understand the structures of different viruses, and then help us to explore effective vaccines. Hence, predicting new protein structures is very important for human health. However, the structure of protein is complicated. Exploration using human experiments is cost-consuming. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as imitation learning and reinforcement learning (RL), has been rapidly developed and significantly improved the efficiency in many different domains. In this project, we will try to use RL to solve the protein folding structure prediction problem.First, we adopted the PH structure as a relatively simple representation of the protein structure, where different peptides can be categorized into two types: P(hydrophilic) and H(hydrophobic). The goal of the protein folding is to try to make more H pairs during the folding process. We then formulated the protein folding problem as a reinforcement learning process. If a new H pair is generated during folding, we collect -1 reward. Such RL reward is designed based on the protein dataset (Protein Data Bank). Finally, we implemented three RL algorithms: 1) Q-learning, 2) Deep Q-learning, and 3) Double Deep Q-learning (DDQN).We implemented and compared the three algorithms in terms of their accuracy and efficiency. We found that all three algorithms can accurately predict the structures of simple proteins.

ID-1725,inproceedings,DeepASPeer: towards an aspect-level sentiment controllable framework for decision prediction from academic peer reviews,"Peer review is the widely accepted mechanism to determine the quality of scientific work. Even though peer-reviewing has been an integral part of academia since the 1600s, it frequently receives criticism for the lack of transparency and consistency. Even for humans, predicting the peer review outcome is a challenging task as there are many dimensions and human factors involved. However, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can assist the editor/chair anticipate the final decision based on the reviews from the human reviewers. Peer review texts reflect the reviewers' opinions/ sentiments on various aspects (e.g., novelty, substance, soundness, etc.) of the paper concerning the research in the paper, which may be valuable to predict a manuscript's acceptance or rejection. The exact types and number of aspects could vary from one to the other venue (i.e., the conferences or journals). Peer review texts, however, which often contain rich sentiment information about the reviewers and, therefore, their overall opinion of the paper's research, can be useful in predicting a manuscript's acceptance or rejection. Here in this work, we study how we could take advantage of aspects and their corresponding sentiment to build a generic controllable system to assist the editor/chair in determining the outcome based on the reviews of a paper to make better editorial decisions. Our proposed deep neural architecture considers three information channels, including reviews, review aspect category, and its sentiment, to predict the final decision. Experimental results show that our model can achieve up to 76.67% accuracy on the ASAP-Review dataset (Aspect-enhanced Peer Review) consisting of ICLR and NIPS reviews considering the sentiment of the reviews.

ID-1727,inproceedings,An Automated Personal Carbon Footprint Calculator for Estimating Carbon Emissions from Transportation Use,"Transportation is one of the biggest menaces to the planet, releasing several million tons of gases into the atmosphere on an annual basis. The growing use of transportation has expanded the concentration and release of these gases, which affect the environment in a number of ways such as depletion of the ozone layer, air pollution and more seriously, global warming and climate change. Among the different modes, road transportation is a significant contributor of greenhouse gas as it ejects dangerous gases directly into the atmosphere, and these emissions are predicted to increase drastically over the years. As such, it is essential to track and monitor emissions from transportation activities in an attempt to reduce the global emissions of greenhouse gases, through carbon footprint calculators. However, most of these calculators do not solely focus on transportation and the ones that do, require a substantial amount of effort and manual input. this paper investigates acceptance of an automated personal transportation-based carbon footprint calculator and its accuracy in monitoring and reducing carbon emissions. As part of this study, a mobile application called TCTracker was implemented using Global Positioning System (GPS) functionality and built-in artificial intelligence (AI) features. The acceptance of the tool was evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model whereby involving forty users to evaluate four constructs notably, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use.

ID-1732,inproceedings,Designing Shapelets for Interpretable Data-Agnostic Classification,"Time series shapelets are discriminatory subsequences which are representative of a class, and their similarity to a time series can be used for successfully tackling the time series classification problem. The literature shows that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems adopting classification models based on time series shapelets can be interpretable, more accurate, and significantly fast. Thus, in order to design a data-agnostic and interpretable classification approach, in this paper we first extend the notion of shapelets to different types of data, i.e., images, tabular and textual data. Then, based on this extended notion of shapelets we propose an interpretable data-agnostic classification method. Since the shapelets discovery can be time consuming, especially for data types more complex than time series, we exploit a notion of prototypes for finding candidate shapelets, and reducing both the time required to find a solution and the variance of shapelets. A wide experimentation on datasets of different types shows that the data-agnostic prototype-based shapelets returned by the proposed method empower an interpretable classification which is also fast, accurate, and stable. In addition, we show and we prove that shapelets can be at the basis of explainable AI methods.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3461702.3462553,3,,,,,,,Riccardo Guidotti and Anna Monreale,10.1145/3461702.3462553,,,,"decision support systems,explainable artificial intelligence,interpretable machine learning,transparent classification method",,,532-542,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3461702.3462553,2021,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1733,article,Data Transparency and Fairness Analysis of the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Program,"Given the increased concern of racial disparities in the stop-and-frisk programs, the New York Police Department (NYPD) requires publicly displaying detailed data for all the stops conducted by police authorities, including the suspected offense and race of the suspects. By adopting a public data transparency policy, it becomes possible to investigate racial biases in stop-and-frisk data and demonstrate the benefit of data transparency to approve or disapprove social beliefs and police practices. Thus, data transparency becomes a crucial need in the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where police and justice increasingly use different AI techniques not only to understand police practices but also to predict recidivism, crimes, and terrorism. In this study, we develop a predictive analytics method, including bias metrics and bias mitigation techniques to analyze the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk datasets and discover whether underline bias patterns are responsible for stops and arrests. In addition, we perform a fairness analysis on two protected attributes, namely, the race and the gender, and investigate their impacts on arrest decisions. We also apply bias mitigation techniques. The experimental results show that the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk dataset is not biased toward colored and Hispanic individuals and thus law enforcement authorities can apply the bias predictive analytics method to inculcate more fair decisions before making any arrests.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3460533,3,,,,,,,Youakim Badr and Rahul Sharma,10.1145/3460533,1936-1955,2,J.

ID-1734,inproceedings,Adaptive Incentive Design with Multi-Agent Meta-Gradient Reinforcement Learning,"Critical sectors of human society are progressing toward the adoption of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are trained individually on behalf of self-interested principals but deployed in a shared environment. Short of direct centralized regulation of AI, which is as difficult an issue as regulation of human actions, one must design institutional mechanisms that indirectly guide agents' behaviors to safeguard and improve social welfare in the shared environment. Our paper focuses on one important class of such mechanisms: the problem of adaptive incentive design, whereby a central planner intervenes on the payoffs of an agent population via incentives in order to optimize a system objective. To tackle this problem in high-dimensional environments whose dynamics may be unknown or too complex to model, we propose a model-free meta-gradient method to learn an adaptive incentive function in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Via the principle of online cross-validation, the incentive designer explicitly accounts for its impact on agents' learning and, through them, the impact on future social welfare. Experiments on didactic benchmark problems show that the proposed method can induce selfish agents to learn near-optimal cooperative behavior and significantly outperform learning-oblivious baselines. When applied to a complex simulated economy, the proposed method finds tax policies that achieve better trade-off between economic productivity and equality than baselines, a result that we interpret via a detailed behavioral analysis.",,3,,,,,,,Jiachen Yang and Ethan Wang and Rakshit Trivedi and Tuo Zhao and Hongyuan Zha,,,,,"incentive design,multi-agent reinforcement learning",,,1436-1445,,International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,,,2022,"Richland, SC",

At the same time, in recent years, with the continuous improvement of living standards, more and more people choose to travel by air transportation with fast speed and good service. In addition, the number of airlines continues to increase and the high-speed railway network is also constantly developing. How airlines should reflect their advantages in the fierce market competition requires continuous improvement of the quality and level of aviation services. This article mainly adopts experimental analysis method and questionnaire survey method to explore the application of AI technology in aviation intelligent service. This paper investigates and analyzes the application function verification of intelligent service robots and the services that passengers of different ages hope to improve civil aviation.

ID-1736,inproceedings,Pricing the Long Tail by Explainable Product Aggregation and Monotonic Bandits,"In several e-commerce scenarios, pricing long-tail products effectively is a central task for the companies, and there is broad agreement that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a prominent role in doing that in the next future. Nevertheless, dealing with long-tail products raises major open technical issues due to data scarcity which preclude the adoption of the mainstream approaches requiring usually a huge amount of data, such as, e.g., deep learning. In this paper, we provide a novel online learning algorithm for dynamic pricing that deals with non-stationary settings due to, e.g., the seasonality or adaptive competitors, and is very efficient in terms of the need for data thanks to assumptions such as, e.g., the monotonicity of the demand curve in the price that are customarily satisfied in long-tail markets. Furthermore, our dynamic pricing algorithm is paired with a clustering algorithm for the long-tail products which aggregates similar products such that the data of all the products of the same cluster are merged and used to choose their best price. We first evaluate our algorithms in an offline synthetic setting, comparing their performance with the state of the art and showing that our algorithms are more robust and data-efficient in long-tail settings. Subsequently, we evaluate our algorithms in an online setting with more than 8,000 products, including popular and long-tail, in an A/B test with humans for about two months. The increase of revenue thanks to our algorithms is about 18% for the popular products and about 90% for the long-tail products.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3534678.3539142,3,,,,,,,Marco Mussi and Gianmarco Genalti and Francesco Trovò and Alessandro Nuara and Nicola Gatti and Marcello Restelli,10.1145/3534678.3539142,,,,"bayesian model,drop-shipping,e-commerce,explainable model,long-tail,multi-armed bandit,online learning,pricing",,,3623-3633,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3534678.3539142,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1737,inproceedings,An Exploratory Diagnosis of Artificial Intelligence Risks for a Responsible Governance.,"Our lives have been increasingly filled with technologies that use Artificial Intelligence (AI), whether at home, in public spaces, in social organizations, or in services. Like other technologies, adopting this emerging technology also requires society’s attention to the challenges that may arise from it. The media brought to the public some unexpected results from using these technologies, for example, the unfairness case in the COMPAS system. It became more evident that these technologies can have unintended consequences. In particular, in the public interest domain, these unintended consequences and their origin are a challenge for public policies, governance, and responsible AI. This work aims to identify the technological and ethical risks in data-driven decision systems based on AI and conduct a diagnosis of these risks and their perception. To do that, we use a triangulation of methods. In the first stage, a search on Web of Science has been performed. We consider all the 412 papers. The second stage corresponds to a analysis of experts. The papers have been classified according to the relevance to the topic by the experts. In the third stage, we use the survey method and include risk insights from stage two in our questions. We found 24 concerns which arise from the perspective of the ethical and technological risk perspective. The perception of participants regarding the level of concern they have with the risks of a data-driven system based on AI is high than their perception of society’s concern. Fairness is considered the risk whose perception is more severe. Fairness, Bias, Accountability, Interpretability, and Explainability are considered the most relevant concepts for a responsible AI. Consequently, also the most relevant for responsible governance of AI.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3560107.3560298,3,,,,,,,Sónia Teixeira and José Rodrigues and Bruno Veloso and João Gama,10.1145/3560107.3560298,,,,"Artificial Intelligence,Diagnosis of the Situation,Ethical Risks,Governance,Risk Perception,Technological Risks",,,25-31,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3560107.3560298,2022,"New York, NY, USA",

However, existing algorithms are not directly applicable in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment due to the hardware constraints of processing power. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and accurate IoT-based ALPR solution using deep learning. First, a newly trained YOLOv4-tiny model based on Malaysian car plate is attained via transfer learning. Second, OpenVINO is adopted to optimize the trained model for faster inference time. Third, centroid tracking and geofencing are utilized to collect multiple image instances of the same car plate. Fourth, OpenCV image processing is invoked to segment the characters of each image instance before feeding them into the Tesseract optical character recognition (OCR) engine for character recognition. Fifth, a weighted selection algorithm is designed to choose the best car plate number among the pooled samples. Lastly, the entire solution is deployed in the Up Squared board and powered by the popular IoT Node-Red. Results reveal that the proposed solution has a frame per second (FPS) of 2.6 using Intel Movidius Myriad X, detection accuracy of 99.02 %, and license plate optical character recognition (OCR) accuracy of 78.23%.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3502814.3502816,3,,,,,,,Mau-Luen Tham and Wei Kun Tan,10.1145/3502814.3502816,,,,"Automatic License Plate Recognition,Deep Learning,IoT,OpenVINO",,,7-14,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3502814.3502816,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1739,inproceedings,Medical Symptom Detection in Intelligent Pre-Consultation Using Bi-directional Hard-Negative Noise Contrastive Estimation,"Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in medical applications is helping our world to deal with the shortage of healthcare workers and improve the efficiency and productivity of healthcare delivery. Intelligent pre-consultation (IPC) is a relatively new application deployed on mobile terminals for collecting patient's information before a face-to-face consultation. It takes advantages of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to assist doctors on clinical decision-making. One of key functions of IPC is to detect medical symptoms from patient queries. By extracting symptoms from patient queries, IPC is able to collect more information on patient's health status by asking symptom-related questions. All collected information will be summarized as a medical record for doctors to make clinical decision. This saves a great deal of time for both doctors and patients. Detecting symptoms from patient's query is challenging, as most patients lack medical background and often tend to use colloquial language to describe their symptoms. In this work, we formulate symptom detection as a retrieval problem and propose a bi-directional hard-negative enforced noise contrastive estimation method (Bi-hardNCE) to tackle the symptom detection problem. Bi-hardNCE has both forward contrastive estimation and backward contrastive estimation, which forces model to distinguish the true symptom from negative symptoms and meanwhile distinguish true query from negative queries. To include more informative negatives, our Bi-hardNCE adopts a hard-negative mining strategy and a false-negative eliminating strategy, which achieved a significant improvement on performance. Our proposed model outperforms commonly used retrieval models by a large margin.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3534678.3539124,3,,,,,,,Shiwei Zhang and Jichao Sun and Yu Huang and Xueqi Ding and Yefeng Zheng,10.1145/3534678.3539124,,,,"hard negatives,medical symptom detection,noise contrastive estimation,pre-consultation",,,4551-4559,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3534678.3539124,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1740,inproceedings,Tutorial: Neuro-symbolic AI for Mental Healthcare,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for mental healthcare (MHCare) have been ever-growing after realizing the importance of early interventions for patients with chronic mental health (MH) conditions. Social media (SocMedia) emerged as the go-to platform for supporting patients seeking MHCare. The creation of peer-support groups without social stigma has resulted in patients transitioning from clinical settings to SocMedia supported interactions for quick help. Researchers started exploring SocMedia content in search of cues that showcase correlation or causation between different MH conditions to design better interventional strategies. User-level Classification-based AI systems were designed to leverage diverse SocMedia data from various MH conditions, to predict MH conditions. Subsequently, researchers created classification schemes to measure the severity of each MH condition. Such ad-hoc schemes, engineered features, and models not only require a large amount of data but fail to allow clinically acceptable and explainable reasoning over the outcomes. To improve Neural-AI for MHCare, infusion of clinical symbolic knowledge that clinicans use in decision making is required. An impactful use case of Neural-AI systems in MH is conversational systems. These systems require coordination between classification and generation to facilitate humanistic conversation in conversational agents (CA). Current CAs with deep language models lack factual correctness, medical relevance, and safety in their generations, which intertwine with unexplainable statistical classification techniques. This lecture-style tutorial will demonstrate our investigations into Neuro-symbolic methods of infusing clinical knowledge to improve the outcomes of Neural-AI systems to improve interventions for MHCare:(a) We will discuss the use of diverse clinical knowledge in creating specialized datasets to train Neural-AI systems effectively. (b) Patients with cardiovascular disease express MH symptoms differently based on gender differences. We will show that knowledge-infused Neural-AI systems can identify gender-specific MH symptoms in such patients.

Our findings suggest that the VR enactment of moral dilemmas further fosters utilitarian decision-making, while it amplifies biases such as sparing juveniles and seeking retribution.

ID-1748,inproceedings,Fairness evaluation in deepfake detection models using metamorphic testing,"Fairness of deepfake detectors in the presence of anomalies are not well investigated, especially if those anomalies are more prominent in either male or female subjects. The primary motivation for this work is to evaluate how deepfake detection model behaves under such anomalies. However, due to the black-box nature of deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, it is hard to predict the performance of a model when the input data is modified. Crucially, if this defect is not addressed properly, it will adversely affect the fairness of the model and result in discrimination of certain sub-population unintentionally. Therefore, the objective of this work is to adopt metamorphic testing to examine the reliability of the selected deepfake detection model, and how the transformation of input variation places influence on the output. We have chosen MesoInception-4, a state-of-the-art deepfake detection model, as the target model and makeup as the anomalies. Makeups are applied through utilizing the Dlib library to obtain the 68 facial landmarks prior to filling in the RGB values. Metamorphic relations are derived based on the notion that realistic perturbations of the input images, such as makeup, involving eyeliners, eyeshadows, blushes, and lipsticks (which are common cosmetic appearance) applied to male and female images, should not alter the output of the model by a huge margin. Furthermore, we narrow down the scope to focus on revealing potential gender biases in DL and AI systems. Specifically, we are interested to examine whether MesoInception-4 model produces unfair decisions, which should be considered as a consequence of robustness issues.

We present an inter-disciplinary (computer science, criminology and conservation science) socio-technical artificial intelligence (AI) approach to information extraction from the long tail of online forums around internet-facilitated illegal trades of endangered species. Our methodology is highly iterative, taking entities of interest (e.g. endangered plant species, suspects, locations) identified by a criminologist and using them to direct computer science tools including crawling, searching and information extraction over many steps until an acceptable resulting intelligence package is achieved. We evaluate our approach using two case study experiments, each based on a one-week duration criminology investigation (aided by conservation science experts) and evaluate both named entity (NE) directed graph visualization and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling. NE directed graph visualization consistently outperforms topic modelling for discovering connected entities in the long tail of online forums and marketplaces.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3394332.3402838,3,,,,,,,Stuart E.

ID-1752,inproceedings,Potential Use of Digital Assistants by Governments for Citizen Services: The Case of Germany,"The German government has recently announced a national strategy for making Germany one of the leading locations for artificial intelligence (AI) worldwide. While the AI technology has been around since 1950s, the rise of it has been inescapable over the past decades. Current developments and widespread applications of intelligent technologies show signs that they will become even more prevalent in our lives. In public administrations, AI can support faster decision-making and increase responsiveness leading to higher citizen satisfaction. Digital assistants can carry out a wide range of functions ranging from checking applications against fraud to approval of state benefits or other claims. Yet, no matter how groundbreaking the technology is, its acceptance by citizens is the ultimate criterion of success, as in the case of all services offered by governments. We argue careful consideration needs to be given to citizen perspective as AI projects have high deployment and maintenance costs.

Financial management is also a relatively important part of the entire enterprise management. From the current Telecom enterprise, there are problems in these aspects. The financial management lacks advanced management concepts, and the financial functions cannot reach the overall control level of the enterprise and the financial department. Collaboration with other departments of the enterprise is not in place. And in the current financial work, AI technology also has certain applications, such as AI financial robots, which will handle many repetitive, standardized, and procedural financial tasks more accurately and quickly. This article adopts the questionnaire method and experimental analysis method to analyze and research the construction of Telecom's smart FMS from the perspective of AI, learn about the existing problems in the FMS of the surveyed company, and analyze the interviewee's The attitude of the necessity of a smart FMS. According to the survey results, both M branch company and G branch company have corresponding problems in the FMS. Among them, financial information construction problems and financial accounting system problems account for a large proportion. A total of 30 of the 50 interviewees think it is necessary to build a smart FMS.

Generating an efficient test list with the optimal size is the most challenging problem in combinatorial interaction testing. Adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms as the main algorithm for CIT strategies to generate the most optimal test lists. Kidney algorithm (KA) is a recent computational AI algorithm with sufficient optimization capability which outperforms the other AI algorithms (such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Cuckoo Search (CS), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Harmony Search (HS)) from some aspects. Although, KA may be easy to fall into local optima by keeping the worst solutions from the past generation as a new population with the best solutions. This study proposes to embed the elitism in the KA to preserve only the best solutions and swap the worsts by the new random solutions.

ID-1762,inproceedings,A Multi-Agent Approach to Combine Reasoning and Learning for an Ethical Behavior,"The recent field of Machine Ethics is experiencing rapid growth to answer the societal need for Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms imbued with ethical considerations, such as benevolence toward human users and actors. Several approaches already exist for this purpose, mostly either by reasoning over a set of predefined ethical principles (Top-Down), or by learning new principles (Bottom-Up). While both methods have their own advantages and drawbacks, only few works have explored hybrid approaches, such as using symbolic rules to guide the learning process for instance, combining the advantages of each. This paper draws upon existing works to propose a novel hybrid method using symbolic judging agents to evaluate the ethics of learning agents' behaviors, and accordingly improve their ability to ethically behave in dynamic multi-agent environments. Multiple benefits ensue from this separation between judging and learning agents: agents can evolve (or be updated by human designers) separately, benefiting from co-construction processes; judging agents can act as accessible proxies for non-expert human stakeholders or regulators; and finally, multiple points of view (one per judging agent) can be adopted to judge the behavior of the same agent, which produces a richer feedback. Our proposed approach is applied to an energy distribution problem, in the context of a Smart Grid simulator, with continuous and multi-dimensional states and actions. The experiments and results show the ability of learning agents to correctly adapt their behaviors to comply with the judging agents' rules, including when rules evolve over time.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3461702.3462515,3,,,,,,,Rémy Chaput and Jérémy Duval and Olivier Boissier and Mathieu Guillermin and Salima Hassas,10.1145/3461702.3462515,,,,"ethical judgment,ethics,hybrid neural-symbolic learning,machine ethics,multi-agent learning,reinforcement learning",,,13-23,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3461702.3462515,2021,"New York, NY, USA",

Finally, we use an image classification problem in artificial intelligence (AI) to validate our idea.

While most of NIDS studies focus on improving classification/detection accuracy by proposing new AI/ML models, all models produce a ratio of false positive alerts in the field. Very few studies discuss the methodology to handle false positive alerts. Giving a busy network, handling the number of false positive alerts become a time consuming task for security personnel. For this reason, false positive alert filtering automation is an important issue. In this paper, we propose a scheme to automate false positive alert filtering by leveraging kernel density estimation. Disregard of the deployed NIDS, our proposed scheme can assist security personnel in alert verification task.

This article aims to explore these discrepancies in order to provide a theoretical contribution of a list of factors related to perceived humanness in chatbots and how these may consequently lead to a positive user experience. The results suggest that a chatbot should have the following characteristics: avoiding small talk and maintaining a formal tone; identifying itself as a bot and asking how it can help; providing specific information and articulating itself with sophisticated choices of words and well-constructed sentences; asking follow-up questions during decision-making processes and; providing an apology when the context is not comprehensible, followed by a question or a statement to dynamically move a conversation forward.

ID-1766,article,INN: An Interpretable Neural Network for AI Incubation in Manufacturing,"Both artificial intelligence (AI) and domain knowledge from human experts play an important role in manufacturing decision making. Smart manufacturing emphasizes a fully automated data-driven decision-making; however, the AI incubation process involves human experts to enhance AI systems by integrating domain knowledge for modeling, data collection and annotation, and feature extraction. Such an AI incubation process not only enhances the domain knowledge discovery but also improves the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI methods. In this article, we focus on the knowledge transfer from human experts to a supervised learning problem by learning domain knowledge as interpretable features and rules, which can be used to construct rule-based systems to support manufacturing decision making, such as process modeling and quality inspection. Although many advanced statistical and machine learning methods have shown promising modeling accuracy and efficiency, rule-based systems are still highly preferred and widely adopted due to their interpretability for human experts to comprehend. However, most of the existing rule-based systems are constructed based on deterministic human-crafted rules, whose parameters, such as thresholds of decision rules, are suboptimal. Yet the machine learning methods, such as tree models or neural networks, can learn a decision rule based structure without much interpretation or agreement with domain knowledge. Therefore, the traditional machine learning models and human experts’ domain knowledge cannot be directly improved by learning from data. In this research, we propose an interpretable neural network (INN) model with a center-adjustable sigmoid activation function to efficiently optimize the rule-based systems. Using the rule-based system from domain knowledge to regulate the INN architecture not only improves the prediction accuracy with optimized parameters but also ensures the interpretability by adopting the interpretable rule-based systems from domain knowledge. The proposed INN will be effective for supervised learning problems when rule-based systems are available. The merits of the INN model are demonstrated via a simulation study and a real case study in the quality modeling of a semiconductor manufacturing process.

We conducted interviews with 20 data scientists who work at a large, multinational technology company and practice data science in various business settings. Our goal is to understand their current work practices and how these practices might change with AutoAI. Reactions were mixed: while informants expressed concerns about the trend of automating their jobs, they also strongly felt it was inevitable. Despite these concerns, they remained optimistic about their future job security due to a view that the future of data science work will be a collaboration between humans and AI systems, in which both automation and human expertise are indispensable.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3359313,3,,,,,,,Dakuo Wang and Justin D Weisz and Michael Muller and Parikshit Ram and Werner Geyer and Casey Dugan and Yla Tausczik and Horst Samulowitz and Alexander Gray,10.1145/3359313,,CSCW,Proc.

ID-1769,inproceedings,Text Classification and Mark Key Fragment,"In this paper, a novel architecture is proposed to classify website essays to two classes, ""acception"" or ""need-improvement"", and at the same time mark the key text fragment that influence the final prediction. All essays come from an important popular official website. They are submitted by users around China, and reviewed by human reviewers to decide which one is accepted to be published on website or needing more improvement. In the past eight years human reviewers have accumulated a large labeled dataset, which can be used as the train data and test data for training an artificial intelligence (AI) model to aid human reviewers. Because the AI model can't be 100% reliable, the model is designed not only predict the classification, but also mark the key fragment that influence the final prediction. For human perspective, it seems like the AI model gives out the reason why an essay is accepted or where needs improvement. This will definitely help human reviewers to accelerate the examine process. The final trained model can correctly classify 93.6% sample essays in test set and the positive samples (accepted essay) recall is 96.7%. The most interesting thing is even human reviewers never tell why an essay is rejected (where needs improvement) in train data, the model can give out the reason by marking the key fragment, where need improvement. After checked by human reviewers, it works really well.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3404687.3404702,3,,,,,,,Zhang Yong and Zhu Lisong,10.1145/3404687.3404702,,,,"Attention,Deep Learning,GRU,Gated Recurrent Unit,Machine Learning,NLP,Nature Language Processing,RNN,Recurrent Neural Network,Text Classification",,,74-78,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3404687.3404702,2020,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1770,inproceedings,The Integrated Development Evaluation of Tourism Industry from the Perspective of Global Tourism Based on Artificial Intelligence Model,"With the continuous improvement of people's material living standards, tourism is an important part of people's leisure life in modern society, and global tourism(GT) has also become a major trend. It is a lifestyle of a well-off and affluent level. The development of GT is to conform to the needs of this lifestyle. Although the current GT creation work has made phased achievements, it has promoted regional reform and opening up and economic and social development, and promoted targeted poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation. There are still certain problems in the integrated development of the tourism industry(TI), such as lack of tourism marketing strategies, inadequate tourism planning, lack of management experience and talents, and so on. How to develop GT, solve the current contradictions, thus conform to market demand, follow the law of industrial development, and promote the sustainable development of GT is an important issue in the development of the current TI. This paper adopts the questionnaire method and digital analysis method to study the integrated development evaluation of the TI from the perspective of GT based on the artificial intelligence(AI) model. It is intended to explore how to use the advantages of AI to promote the integrated development of the TI from the perspective of regional tourism. This article analyzes the opinions of interviewees of different ages on the integrated development of the TI and their channels for GT. The survey results show that more people don't know much about the integrated development of the TI, and compared with the young and the elderly, middle-aged people have a better understanding of this aspect and are more supportive of the integrated development of the TI. In addition, most of the interviewees obtains relevant information about GT through TV and smart phone channels. Therefore, this article is based on the AI model to study the integrated development evaluation of the TI from the perspective of GT, which meets the requirements of the times and is of practical significance.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3495018.3495458,3,,,,,,,Guoquan Wang and Tiantian Dong and Yongchao Chu and Dongzhe Shi and Jianmin Ding and Chang Chen,10.1145/3495018.3495458,,,,,,,1639-1643,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3495018.3495458,2022,"New York, NY, USA",

The remarkable expansion of the embedded ICT market, together with the rise and breakthroughs of Artificial Intelligence (AI), have put the focus on the Edge as it stands as one of the keys for the next technological revolution: the seamless integration of AI in our daily life. However, training and deployment of custom AI solutions on embedded devices require a fine-grained integration of data, algorithms, and tools to achieve high accuracy and overcome functional and non-functional requirements. Such integration requires a high level of expertise that becomes a real bottleneck for small and medium enterprises wanting to deploy AI solutions on the Edge, which, ultimately, slows down the adoption of AI on applications in our daily life.In this work, we present a modular AI pipeline as an integrating framework to bring data, algorithms, and deployment tools together. By removing the integration barriers and lowering the required expertise, we can interconnect the different stages of particular tools and provide a modular end-to-end development of AI products for embedded devices. Our AI pipeline consists of four modular main steps: (i) data ingestion, (ii) model training, (iii) deployment optimization, and (iv) the IoT hub integration. To show the effectiveness of our pipeline, we provide examples of different AI applications during each of the steps. Besides, we integrate our deployment framework, Low-Power Deep Neural Network (LPDNN), into the AI pipeline and present its lightweight architecture and deployment capabilities for embedded devices. Finally, we demonstrate the results of the AI pipeline by showing the deployment of several AI applications such as keyword spotting, image classification, and object detection on a set of well-known embedded platforms, where LPDNN consistently outperforms all other popular deployment frameworks.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3403572,3,,,,,,,Miguel De Prado and Jing Su and Rabia Saeed and Lorenzo Keller and Noelia Vallez and Andrew Anderson and David Gregg and Luca Benini and Tim Llewellynn and Nabil Ouerhani and Rozenn Dahyot and Nuria Pazos,10.1145/3403572,,4,ACM Trans.

ID-1773,article,Conceptual Metaphors Impact Perceptions of Human-AI Collaboration,"With the emergence of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) agents, it is important to understand the mechanisms that influence users' experiences of these agents. In this paper, we study one of the most common tools in the designer's toolkit: conceptual metaphors. Metaphors can present an agent as akin to a wry teenager, a toddler, or an experienced butler. How might a choice of metaphor influence our experience of the AI agent? Sampling a set of metaphors along the dimensions of warmth and competence—defined by psychological theories as the primary axes of variation for human social perception—we perform a study (N=260) where we manipulate the metaphor, but not the behavior, of a Wizard-of-Oz conversational agent. Following the experience, participants are surveyed about their intention to use the agent, their desire to cooperate with the agent, and the agent's usability. Contrary to the current tendency of designers to use high competence metaphors to describe AI products, we find that metaphors that signal low competence lead to better evaluations of the agent than metaphors that signal high competence. This effect persists despite both high and low competence agents featuring identical, human-level performance and the wizards being blind to condition. A second study confirms that intention to adopt decreases rapidly as competence projected by the metaphor increases. In a third study, we assess effects of metaphor choices on potential users' desire to try out the system and find that users are drawn to systems that project higher competence and warmth. These results suggest that projecting competence may help attract new users, but those users may discard the agent unless it can quickly correct with a lower competence metaphor. We close with a retrospective analysis that finds similar patterns between metaphors and user attitudes towards past conversational agents such as Xiaoice, Replika, Woebot, Mitsuku, and Tay.",https://dl-acm-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3415234,1,1,1,,warmth/competence,,"self-reported Likert questions on usability, intention to use, plus LIWC measures of conversational behavior",Pranav Khadpe and Ranjay Krishna and Li Fei-Fei and Jeffrey T Hancock and Michael S Bernstein,10.1145/3415234,,CSCW2,Proc.

ID-1777,article,Artificial Intelligence for Modeling Complex Systems: Taming the Complexity of Expert Models to Improve Decision Making,"Major societal and environmental challenges involve complex systems that have diverse multi-scale interacting processes. Consider, for example, how droughts and water reserves affect crop production and how agriculture and industrial needs affect water quality and availability. Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort.We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations. This framework is implemented in the MINT (Model INTegration) framework, and currently includes data and models to analyze the interactions between natural and human systems involving climate, water availability, agricultural production, and markets.

This can be achieved through Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning. Planning is intended as the ability of a WoT system to construct a sequence of actions, that when executed by the smart devices, achieves an effect on the environment in response to an end user issued goal. The problem of planning specifically for the WoT domain has not been sufficiently dealt with in the existing literature. The existing planning approaches do not deal with one or more of the following important factors in the context of WoT: (1) random unexpected events (2) unpredictable device effects leading to side effects at runtime, and (3) durative effects. In this work, we propose a cyclic planning system which adopted a PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) process solution to deal with the existing shortcomings for continuous improvement. The planner employs domain knowledge based on the WoTDL (Web of Things Description Language) ontology.The cyclic planner enables continuous plan monitoring to cope with inconsistencies with user issued goals.

ID-1779,inproceedings,Responsible Autonomy,"The main challenge that artificial intelligence research is facing nowadays is how to guarantee the development of responsible technology. And, in particular, how to guarantee that autonomy is responsible. The social fears on the actions taken by AI can only be appeased by providing ethical certification and transparency of systems. (See for instance the Barcelona declaration https://www.iiia.csic.es/barcelonadeclaration/) However, this is certainly not an easy task. As we very well know in the multiagent systems field, the prediction accuracy of system outcomes has limits as multiagent systems are actually examples of complex systems. And AI will be social, there will be thousands of AI systems interacting among themselves and with a multitude of humans; AI will necessarily be multiagent. Although we cannot provide complete guarantees on outcomes, we must be able to define with accuracy what autonomous behaviour is acceptable (ethical), to provide repair methods for anomalous behaviour and to explain the rationale of AI decisions. Ideally, we should be able to guarantee responsible behaviour of individual AI systems by construction.I understand by an ethical AI system one that is capable of deciding what are the most convenient norms, abide by them and make them evolve and adapt. The area of multiagent systems has developed a number of theoretical and practical tools that properly combined can provide a path to develop such systems, that is, provide means to build ethical-by-construction systems: agreement technologies to decide on acceptable ethical behaviour, normative frameworks to represent and reason on ethics, and electronic institutions to operationalise ethical interactions. Along my career, I have contributed with tools on these three areas.

ID-1780,inproceedings,Privacy-preserving Crowd-guided AI Decision-making in Ethical Dilemmas,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), ethical issues surrounding AI have attracted increasing attention. In particular, autonomous vehicles may face moral dilemmas in accident scenarios, such as staying the course resulting in hurting pedestrians or swerving leading to hurting passengers. To investigate such ethical dilemmas, recent studies have adopted preference aggregation, in which each voter expresses her/his preferences over decisions for the possible ethical dilemma scenarios, and a centralized system aggregates these preferences to obtain the winning decision. Although a useful methodology for building ethical AI systems, such an approach can potentially violate the privacy of voters since moral preferences are sensitive information and their disclosure can be exploited by malicious parties resulting in negative consequences. In this paper, we report a first-of-its-kind privacy-preserving crowd-guided AI decision-making approach in ethical dilemmas. We adopt the formal and popular notion of differential privacy to quantify privacy, and consider four granularities of privacy protection by taking voter-/record-level privacy protection and centralized/distributed perturbation into account, resulting in four approaches VLCP, RLCP, VLDP, and RLDP, respectively. Moreover, we propose different algorithms to achieve these privacy protection granularities, while retaining the accuracy of the learned moral preference model. Specifically, VLCP and RLCP are implemented with the data aggregator setting a universal privacy parameter and perturbing the averaged moral preference to protect the privacy of voters' data. VLDP and RLDP are implemented in such a way that each voter perturbs her/his local moral preference with a personalized privacy parameter. Extensive experiments based on both synthetic data and real-world data of voters' moral decisions demonstrate that the proposed approaches achieve high accuracy of preference aggregation while protecting individual voter's privacy.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3357384.3357954,3,,,,,,,Teng Wang and Jun Zhao and Han Yu and Jinyan Liu and Xinyu Yang and Xuebin Ren and Shuyu Shi,10.1145/3357384.3357954,,,,"artificial intelligence,differential privacy,ethical decision making",,,1311-1320,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3357384.3357954,2019,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1781,inproceedings,TIE: energy-efficient tensor train-based inference engine for deep neural network,"In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as the most important and powerful AI technique. However, large DNN models are both storage and computation intensive, posing significant challenges for adopting DNNs in resource-constrained scenarios. Thus, model compression becomes a crucial technique to ensure wide deployment of DNNs.This paper advances the state-of-the-art by considering tensor train (TT) decomposition, an very promising but yet explored compression technique in architecture domain. The method features with the extremely high compression ratio. However, the challenge is that the inference on the TT-format DNN models inherently incurs massive amount of redundant computations, causing significant energy consumption. Thus, the straightforward application of TT decomposition is not feasible.To address this fundamental challenge, this paper develops a computation-efficient inference scheme for TT-format DNN, which enjoys two key merits: 1) it achieves theoretical limit of number of multiplications, thus eliminating all redundant computations; and 2) the multi-stage processing scheme reduces the intensive memory access to all tensor cores, bringing significant energy saving.Based on the novel inference scheme, we develop TIE, a TT-format compressed DNN-targeted inference engine. TIE is highly flexible, supporting different types of networks for different needs. A 16-processing elements (PE) prototype is implemented using CMOS 28nm technology. Operating on 1000MHz, the TIE accelerator consumes 1.74mm2 and 154.8mW. Compared with EIE, TIE achieves 7.22 ~ 10.66 better area efficiency and 3.03 ~ 4.48 better energy efficiency on different workloads, respectively.

In particular, deep learning methods achieve great success in many computer vision problems, such as image classification and object detection. Deep neural networks are very powerful to capture the hierarchical representation of features in massive and complex data by adopting multiple layers of non-linear information processing. Due to the availability of vast and high-resolution geospatial data and efficient high-performance computing architectures, deep learning techniques empower the geospatial system to provide fast and near-human level perception. For example, recent studies have shown deep learning techniques coupled with volunteered geographic information (such as OpenStreetMap data) can accurately extract buildings from satellite imagery for humanitarian mapping in rural African areas. Also, deep learning helps assimilate autonomous vehicles and intelligent transport system by incorporating a great amount of information gathered by traffic cameras and sensors. Moreover, deep learning technology facilitates the discovery of geographic information within unstructured text data across different languages.

ID-1783,inproceedings,PT-spike: a precise-time-dependent single spike neuromorphic architecture with efficient supervised learning,"One of the most exciting advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the last decade is the wide adoption of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), such as Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in real world applications. However, the underlying massive amounts of computation and storage requirement greatly challenge their applicability in resource-limited platforms like drone, mobile phone and IoT devices etc. The third generation of neural network model-Spiking Neural Network (SNN), inspired by the working mechanism and efficiency of human brain, has emerged as a promising solution for achieving more impressive computing and power efficiency within light-weighted devices (e.g. single chip). However, the relevant research activities have been narrowly carried out on conventional rate-based spiking system designs for fulfilling the practical cognitive tasks, underestimating SNN's energy efficiency, throughput and system flexibility. Although the time-based SNN can be more attractive conceptually, its potentials are not unleashed in realistic applications due to lack of efficient coding and practical learning schemes. In this work, a Precise-Time-Dependent Single Spike Neuromorphic Architecture, namely ""PT-Spike"", is developed to bridge this gap. Three constituent hardware-favorable techniques: precise single-spike temporal encoding, efficient supervised temporal learning and fast asymmetric decoding are proposed accordingly to boost the energy efficiency and data processing capability of the time-based SNN at a more compact neural network model size when executing real cognitive tasks. Simulation results show that ""PT-Spike"" demonstrates significant improvements in network size, processing efficiency and power consumption with marginal classification accuracy degradation, when compared with the rate-based SNN and ANN under the similar network configuration.",,3,,,,,,,Tao Liu and Lei Jiang and Yier Jin and Gang Quan and Wujie Wen,,,,,,,,568-573,,IEEE Press,,,2018,,

Experimental data are utilized for training and testing the networks. Current density, temperature, humidity, number of potential cycles, Platinum load and fuel/oxidant flow rates, potential cycle time step are considered as the inputs and the cell potential, Platinum mass loss percentage of the cathode and location of Platinum particles, which are diffused into membrane and deposited there, are regarded as outputs of ANNs. Back propagation (BP) algorithm has been used to train the network. It is observed that when the networks tuned finely, the obtained results from modeling are in good agreement with the experimental data and achieved responses of ANN are acceptable.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/2832987.2833000,3,,,,,,,Nasim Maleki and Erfan Maleki,10.1145/2832987.2833000,,,,"Modeling,PEMFC,Pt /C electrocatalyst degradation,artificial neural networks,back propagation algorithm",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/2832987.2833000,2015,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1785,inproceedings,Compensated-DNN: energy efficient low-precision deep neural networks by compensating quantization errors,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) represent the state-of-the-art in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks involving images, videos, text, and natural language. Their ubiquitous adoption is limited by the high computation and storage requirements of DNNs, especially for energy-constrained inference tasks at the edge using wearable and IoT devices. One promising approach to alleviate the computational challenges is implementing DNNs using low-precision fixed point (&lt;16 bits) representation. However, the quantization error inherent in any Fixed Point (FxP) implementation limits the choice of bit-widths to maintain application-level accuracy. Prior efforts recommend increasing the network size and/or re-training the DNN to minimize loss due to quantization, albeit with limited success.Complementary to the above approaches, we present Compensated-DNN, wherein we propose to dynamically compensate the error introduced due to quantization during execution. To this end, we introduce a new fixed-point representation viz. Fixed Point with Error Compensation (FPEC). The bits in FPEC are split between computation bits vs. compensation bits. The computation bits use conventional FxP notation to represent the number at low-precision. On the other hand, the compensation bits (1 or 2 bits at most) explicitly capture an estimate (direction and magnitude) of the quantization error in the representation. For a given word length, since FPEC uses fewer computation bits compared to FxP representation, we achieve a near-quadratic improvement in energy in the multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. The compensation bits are simultaneously used by a low-overhead sparse compensation scheme to estimate the error accrued during MAC operations, which is then added to the MAC output to minimize the impact of quantization. We build compensated-DNNs for 7 popular image recognition benchmarks with 0.05–20.5 million neurons and 0.01-15.5 billion connections. Based on gate-level analysis at 14nm technology, we achieve 2.65-4.88 and 1.13-1.7 improvement in energy compared to 16-bit and 8-bit FxP implementations respectively, while maintaining &lt;0.5% loss in classification accuracy.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3195970.3196012,3,,,,,,,Shubham Jain and Swagath Venkataramani and Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan and Jungwook Choi and Pierce Chuang and Leland Chang,10.1145/3195970.3196012,,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3195970.3196012,2018,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1791,article,Fixed-point Encoding and Architecture Exploration for Residue Number Systems,"Residue Number Systems (RNS) demonstrate the fascinating potential to serve integer addition/multiplication-intensive applications. The complexity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has grown enormously in recent years. From a computer system’s perspective, ensuring the training of these large-scale AI models within an adequate time and energy consumption has become a big concern. Matrix multiplication is a dominant subroutine in many prevailing AI models, with an addition/multiplication-intensive attribute. However, the data type of matrix multiplication within machine learning training typically requires real numbers, which indicates that RNS benefits for integer applications cannot be directly gained by AI training. The state-of-the-art RNS real number encodings, including floating-point and fixed-point, have defects and can be further enhanced. To transform default RNS benefits to the efficiency of large-scale AI training, we propose a low-cost and high-accuracy RNS fixed-point representation: Single RNS Logical Partition (S-RNS-Logic-P) representation with Scaling Down Postprocessing Multiplication (SD-Post-Mul). Moreover, we extend the implementation details of the other two RNS fixed-point methods: Double RNS Concatenation (D-RNS-Concat) and Single RNS Logical Partition (S-RNS-Logic-P) representation with Scaling Down Preprocessing Multiplication (SD-Pre-Mul). We also design the architectures of these three fixed-point multipliers. In empirical experiments, our S-RNS-Logic-P representation with SD-Post-Mul method achieves less latency and energy overhead while maintaining good accuracy. Furthermore, this method can easily extend to the Redundant Residue Number System (RRNS) to raise the efficiency of error-tolerant domains, such as improving the error correction efficiency of quantum computing.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3664923,3,,,,,,,Bobin Deng and Bhargava Nadendla and Kun Suo and Yixin Xie and Dan Chia-Tien Lo,10.1145/3664923,1544-3566,,ACM Trans.

This has spurred various responses in higher education, including a shift to more in-class and unplugged assessments. At the same time, LLMs are transforming the way that many people work, including professional software developers, and students similarly might be able to use them to enhance their learning. In this paper, we report on our experiences with a permissive policy towards the use of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) tools for assisting students with their programming assignments in CS1 and CS2 courses in the Spring 2023 semester. Students were allowed to use these tools however they wished as long as they submitted a form which included a transcript of their chat and a reflection on what they learned, if anything, through the interaction.

ID-1793,inproceedings,NeiLatS: Neighbor-Aware Latency-Sensitive Application Scheduling in Heterogeneous Cloud-Edge Environment,"The deployment and management of distributed latency-sensitive applications pose significant challenges due to the volatile nature of modern Internet of Things (IoT) edge networks, constrained resources for heterogeneous edge devices, and the increasingly demanding user requirements for service level agreement (SLA) and quality of service (QoS). To address these challenges, Kubernetes (k8s) orchestration platform has emerged, with previous research using heuristics to make scheduling decisions quickly or leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to adapt to changing circumstances. However, the former often struggle to adapt to highly dynamic and resource-competitive edge environments, while the latter’s long decision latency negatively impacts QoS. In this paper, we propose NeiLatS, a heterogeneous cloud-edge cluster scheduling system that addresses these issues. NeiLatS can monitor real-time resource and communication link conditions and make the scheduler latency-aware and location-aware. Additionally, we innovatively propose an efficacy coefficient method with tolerance factor ε (ε -ECM), which fully accounts for multi-resource load balancing, network stability, and future communication link conditions to resolve the conflict between resource utilization balance and QoS. We test NeiLatS on physical clusters and compare it with five different algorithms. Our evaluation results show a 4.59%-16% improvement in resource load balancing degree, a 41.95%-82.85% reduction in SLA violation rates, and a 1-5x improvement in QoS, which greatly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3605573.3605630,3,,,,,,,Huadong Li and Hui Liu and Changyuan Liu and Aoqi Chen and Zhaocheng Niu and Junzhao Du,10.1145/3605573.3605630,,,,"Edge computing,QoS,heterogeneity,load balancing,multi-objective optimization,neighbor-aware,scheduling",,,615-624,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3605573.3605630,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1794,inproceedings,KubeKlone: A Digital Twin for Simulating Edge and Cloud Microservices,"Microservices are terraforming the computing landscape with web-scale infrastructures (e.g., Facebook, Google, Amazon) and telecom infrastructures (e.g., ATT, Ericsson) adopting them. At it’s core, the microservices paradigm promotes a decoupling of applications into multiple services – a decoupling that promotes better scalability, fault-tolerance, and deployability. Unfortunately, this decoupling significantly increases the space of configuration options and performance problems, rendering traditional approaches to management ineffective. Recent efforts to address this problem embrace Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps). However, training effective AI models requires significant amounts of data and, in some instances, a framework for quickly exploring or analyzing model performance. Digital twins, or simulators, have effectively enabled AI-based management frameworks within other domains (e.g., manufacturing, industrial and automotive). In this paper, we propose the design of KubeKlone, the first comprehensive and opensource digital twin for modeling cloud-native microservices applications. KubeKlone is motivated by our need for accurate, efficient, and general model training. KubeKlone satisfies these goals by decoupling the simulation of microservices from the training of machine learning (ML) models while simultaneously ensuring efficiency and simplifying model design. In particular, KubeKlone introduces a queue-based simulator that abstracts infrastructure details and focuses on modeling, with queues, resource contentions across host and network components. To simplify model design, KubeKlone provides interfaces that hide simulator details and provides wrappers around popular ML packages. To illustrate the strengths of KubeKlone, we validate it against a deployment on Google Cloud Engine and implement several AIOps resource management algorithms (including PARTIES).",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3542637.3542642,3,,,,,,,Ayush Bhardwaj and Theophilus A Benson,10.1145/3542637.3542642,,,,,,,29-35,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3542637.3542642,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

Prevalent approaches, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), Internet of Things (IoT) system and Artificial Intelligence (AI), have demonstrated their strength in preventing road accidents, with the support of trustworthy data. However, in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), data transmission and storage are unreliable due to various constraints such as limited physical resource and unsteady topology. Distributed schemes are widely applied in VANETs to enforce multifold protection on vehicular data. In particular, Blockchain has become a promising approach, as it implements the real-sense distributed solution with consensus algorithm and distributed ledger. To this end, we propose a novel system in this paper, which employs Blockchain technology to consolidate the traffic information sharing in VANETs and holds profound significance for intelligent applications. Our system focuses on sharing real-time visual traffic information at the frame level via Blockchain in VANETs. Integrity verification of frames based on their sequences and timestamps is imposed prior to the consensus in Blockchain, coupled with digital watermarking to protect the multimedia traffic data. Improved efficiency and reliability of sharing are achieved by the system dynamically adjusting transaction volume in terms of the frame type and number. With the fault tolerance and immutability of Blockchain, our proposal can solidly protect the traffic information sharing against vandalization in VANETs, and confidently escort the traffic with trustworthy safety guidance.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3416014.3424601,3,,,,,,,Zhaowei Ma and F Richard Yu and Xiantao Jiang and Azzedine Boukerche,10.1145/3416014.3424601,,,,"VANET,blockchain technology,consensus,real-time transport protocol",,,33-40,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3416014.3424601,2020,"New York, NY, USA",

AI based on big data analysis and deep learning algorithms has become the core driving force for the future development of the medical industry, but the biggest obstacle to its development is incompleteness and inaccuracy of medical data. The main reason is that medical big data is difficult to achieve sharing. This paper studies and analyzes the problems of medical big data sharing, proposes a medical data sharing platform based on permissioned blockchains (BCs), which uses dual-BCs architecture (Account BC and transaction BC), Concurrent Byzantine Fault Tolerance (CBFT) consensus mechanism, encryption technology and smart contract technology. Account BC (ABC) is used to store user data hash after encryption and transaction BC (TBC) is used to process computing tasks. The use of encryption technology ensures that users have full autonomy in their own medical data. Smart contract technology is used to enable users to set up different access permissions of medical data. A TBC can be used by multiple ABCs and TBC does not save users' medical data, but only obtains users' medical data from ABCs when needs computation. When the computing task is completed, the TBC deletes all users' medical data and packages the operation record to save into ABCs, thereby it realizes data sharing while protecting users' privacy. In addition, this paper compares the functions with other medical data systems, analyzes and compares their advantages and disadvantages.

However, researchers have discussed an issue that humans can over-rely on wrong suggestions of the AI model instead of achieving human AI complementary performance. In this work, we utilized salient feature explanations along with what-if, counterfactual explanations to make humans review AI suggestions more analytically to reduce overreliance on AI and explored the effect of these explanations on trust and reliance on AI during clinical decision-making. We conducted an experiment with seven therapists and ten laypersons on the task of assessing post-stroke survivors' quality of motion, and analyzed their performance, agreement level on the task, and reliance on AI without and with two types of AI explanations. Our results showed that the AI model with both salient features and counterfactual explanations assisted therapists and laypersons to improve their performance and agreement level on the task when 'right' AI outputs are presented. While both therapists and laypersons over-relied on 'wrong' AI outputs, counterfactual explanations assisted both therapists and laypersons to reduce their over-reliance on 'wrong' AI outputs by 21% compared to salient feature explanations. Specifically, laypersons had higher performance degrades by 18.0 f1-score with salient feature explanations and 14.0 f1-score with counterfactual explanations than therapists with performance degrades of 8.6 and 2.8 f1-scores respectively.

In this paper, we interrogate the naturalization of benchmark datasets as veracious metrics by examining the historical development of benchmarking as an epistemic practice in AI research. Specifically, we highlight three key case studies that were crucial in establishing the existing reliance on benchmark datasets for evaluating the capabilities of AI systems: (1) the sharing of Highleyman’s OCR dataset in the 1960s, which solidified a community of knowledge production around a shared benchmark dataset, (2) the Common Task Framework (CTF) of the 1980s, a state-led project to standardize benchmark datasets as legitimate indicators of technical progress; and (3) the Netflix Prize which further solidified benchmarking as a competitive goal within the ML research community.

ID-1802,article,Coding Integrity Unveiled: Exploring the Pros and Cons of Detecting Plagiarism in Programming Assignments Using Copyleaks,"Before the advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, for example, ChatGPT, students traditionally approached assignment development authentically by employing libraries and by referring to textbooks. However, with the widespread reliance on powerful AI tools for assignment completion, the process has become more convenient. Unfortunately, this ease of use has led to a potential detriment in students' genuine understanding of subjects, as well as a decline in their problem-solving and innovative thinking skills. Moreover, AI tools like ChatGPT will evolve as technology advances such that the need to detect AI-generated content is even more crucial in educational setting to reinforce the value of original work [5]. This paper aims to address this issue by focusing on the detection of plagiarism in student assignments through the utilization of the Copyleaks1 tool, specifically designed to identify AI-generated code. The accuracy of the tool is systematically evaluated by submitting various pairs of codes, each with similar functionality, wherein one is generated by AI and the other by humans.",,3,,,,,,,Chandra Mouli and Madhav Kotteti and Ratan Lal and Prasad Chetti,,1937-4771,6,J.

Among these technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have revolutionized various aspects of life, elevating speed, convenience, and efficiency. However, this reliance on technology has brought forth security concerns that permeate every sector, impacting the network as a whole. This study proposes a solution employing a hashing mechanism for authentication using SHA-256 and implementing the SDN controller for streamlined network operations and detection of potential threats. To address this issue, the development of a comprehensive system capable of authenticating nodes, effectively routing data packets, monitoring network behavior, and detecting malicious nodes is imperative. This is to examine critical aspects necessary to achieve a robust and secure network infrastructure.

ID-1804,inproceedings,Exploration of Explainable AI for Trust Development on Human-AI Interaction,"In recent years, the revolutionary impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) cannot be overstated. This groundbreaking technology has radically transformed how we perform our daily tasks, thereby redefining the very fabric of our society. However, as our reliance on AI systems continues to grow, the need for calibrated trust becomes increasingly pressing. To address this concern, the concept of Explainable AI (XAI) has been introduced to provide human-level explanations. The primary goal is to offer cognitive information that prompts informed trust decisions. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize that trust is a multidimensional construct, involving various means of processing beyond mere explanations. To fully understand and explore these dimensions within the context of XAI, this research aims to uncover and comprehend the additional facets of trust. Through an exploratory survey, it was confirmed that XAI serves a vital purpose in facilitating trust, and it can be effectively processed through affective means. Furthermore, the presentation of information beyond the depth of explanation was found to play a significant role in moderating trust formation during human-AI interactions.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3639592.3639625,3,,,,,,,Ezekiel L Bernardo and Rosemary R Seva,10.1145/3639592.3639625,,,,"Affective Design,Explainable AI,HAI,Human-AI Interaction,KEYWORDS • XAI,Trust",,,238-246,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3639592.3639625,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

Through contextual inquiry and interviews, we set out to understand the use of an existing AI support system by ophthalmologists. We identified concerns regarding anchoring bias and a misunderstanding of the AI’s capabilities. Following, we evaluated clinicians’ perceptions of three bias mitigation strategies as integrated into their existing decision support system. While clinicians recognised the danger of anchoring bias, we identified a concern around the impact of bias mitigation on procedure time.

ID-1806,inproceedings,"Explainable AI is Dead, Long Live Explainable AI! Hypothesis-driven Decision Support using Evaluative AI","In this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the current model of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which may be counter-productive to better human decision making. In early decision support systems, we assumed that we could give people recommendations and that they would consider them, and then follow them when required. However, research found that people often ignore recommendations because they do not trust them; or perhaps even worse, people follow them blindly, even when the recommendations are wrong. Explainable artificial intelligence mitigates this by helping people to understand how and why models give certain recommendations. However, recent research shows that people do not always engage with explainability tools enough to help improve decision making. The assumption that people will engage with recommendations and explanations has proven to be unfounded. We argue this is because we have failed to account for two things. First, recommendations (and their explanations) take control from human decision makers, limiting their agency. Second, giving recommendations and explanations does not align with the cognitive processes employed by people making decisions. This position paper proposes a new conceptual framework called Evaluative AI for explainable decision support. This is a machine-in-the-loop paradigm in which decision support tools provide evidence for and against decisions made by people, rather than provide recommendations to accept or reject. We argue that this mitigates issues of over- and under-reliance on decision support tools, and better leverages human expertise in decision making.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3593013.3594001,3,,,,,,,Tim Miller,10.1145/3593013.3594001,,,,,,,333-342,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3593013.3594001,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

Compared with the traditional concept of the Internet of things, the main difference of AIoT technology is that it applies interconnected devices which are embedded with the capacity of neural network model reasoning to the perception layer, this reduce reliance on edge servers (especially for neural network model training or reasoning). Thus, the edge devices of the system will get a more intelligent execution power. For the IOT system structures that have been built at present, most of the interconnection devices in the sensing layer, such as data acquisition nodes or execution nodes, are designed with the low and medium performance microcontroller unit as the processing core. After using the technology such like lightweight neural network and global average pooling, we succeed in deploying the convolutional neural network model to the low and medium performance microcontroller.

ID-1808,inproceedings,Tribal Knowledge Cocreation in Generative Artificial Intelligence Systems,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems bring innovative ways of information provision and knowledge delivery. In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses. This study contributes to the theory development of digital equity and knowledge cocreation in tribal generative AI system responses.

ID-1809,inproceedings,Capable but Amoral? Comparing AI and Human Expert Collaboration in Ethical Decision Making,"While artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied for decision-making processes, ethical decisions pose challenges for AI applications. Given that humans cannot always agree on the right thing to do, how would ethical decision-making by AI systems be perceived and how would responsibility be ascribed in human-AI collaboration? In this study, we investigate how the expert type (human vs. AI) and level of expert autonomy (adviser vs. decider) influence trust, perceived responsibility, and reliance. We find that participants consider humans to be more morally trustworthy but less capable than their AI equivalent. This shows in participants’ reliance on AI: AI recommendations and decisions are accepted more often than the human expert’s. However, AI team experts are perceived to be less responsible than humans, while programmers and sellers of AI systems are deemed partially responsible instead.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3491102.3517732,1,1,1,,,,,Suzanne Tolmeijer and Markus Christen and Serhiy Kandul and Markus Kneer and Abraham Bernstein,10.1145/3491102.3517732,,,,"Ethical AI,Human-AI Collaboration,Responsibility,Trust",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3491102.3517732,2022,"New York, NY, USA",

Furthermore, developers often want to release these assets to encourage development of technology that leverages their frameworks and services. A number of organizations have expressed concerns about the inappropriate or irresponsible use of AI and have proposed ethical guidelines around the application of such systems. While such guidelines can help set norms and shape policy, they are not easily enforceable.

ID-1811,article,Evaluating the Impact of Human Explanation Strategies on Human-AI Visual Decision-Making,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being deployed in high-stakes domains, such as disaster relief and radiology, to aid practitioners during the decision-making process. Explainable AI techniques have been developed and deployed to provide users insights into why the AI made certain predictions. However, recent research suggests that these techniques may confuse or mislead users. We conducted a series of two studies to uncover strategies that humans use to explain decisions and then understand how those explanation strategies impact visual decision-making. In our first study, we elicit explanations from humans when assessing and localizing damaged buildings after natural disasters from satellite imagery and identify four core explanation strategies that humans employed. We then follow up by studying the impact of these explanation strategies by framing the explanations from Study 1 as if they were generated by AI and showing them to a different set of decision-makers performing the same task. We provide initial insights on how causal explanation strategies improve humans' accuracy and calibrate humans' reliance on AI when the AI is incorrect. However, we also find that causal explanation strategies may lead to incorrect rationalizations when AI presents a correct assessment with incorrect localization.

ID-1812,inproceedings,Visions of a Discipline: Analyzing Introductory AI Courses on YouTube,"Education plays an indispensable role in fostering societal well-being and is widely regarded as one of the most influential factors in shaping the future of generations to come. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more deeply integrated into our daily lives and the workforce, educational institutions at all levels are directing their focus on resources that cater to AI education. Yet, informal education, including online learning on social media platforms like YouTube, plays an increasingly significant role for both students and the general public. Offering greater accessibility compared to formal education, millions of individuals use YouTube for educational resources on AI today. Due to the substantial societal impact of AI, it is crucial for introductory AI courses to meaningfully address the ethical implications associated with AI. Our work investigates the current landscape of introductory AI courses on YouTube, and the potential for introducing ethics in this context. We qualitatively analyze the 20 most watched introductory AI courses on YouTube, coding a total of 92.2 hours of educational content viewed by close to 50 million people. We find that these introductory AI courses do not meaningfully engage with ethical or societal challenges of AI (RQ1). When defining and framing AI, introductory AI courses foreground excitement around AI’s transformative role in society, over-exaggerate AI’s current and future abilities, and anthropomorphize AI (RQ2). In teaching AI, we see a widespread reliance on corporate AI tools and frameworks as well as a prioritization on a hands-on approach to learning rather than on conceptual foundations (RQ3). In promoting key AI practices, introductory AI courses abstract away entirely the socio-technical nature of AI classification and prediction, for example by favoring data quantity over data quality (RQ4). Given the power of openly available introductory courses to shape enduring beliefs around AI and its field at the onset of a learning journey, we extend our analysis with recommendations that aim to integrate ethical reflections into introductory AI courses. We recommend that introductory AI courses should (1) highlight ethical challenges of AI to present a more balanced perspective, (2) raise ethical issues explicitly relevant to the technical concepts discussed and (3) nurture a sense of accountability in future AI developers.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630106.3659045,3,,,,,,,Severin Engelmann and Madiha Zahrah Choksi and Angelina Wang and Casey Fiesler,10.1145/3630106.3659045,,,,"Computer science education,accountability in computer science,artificial intelligence ethics,ethics in computer science education",,,2400-2420,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630106.3659045,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

Prior studies that investigated the interplay between risk and trust perception recommended the development of real-time tools for monitoring cognitive states (e.g., trust). The primary objective of this study was to investigate a feature selection method that yields feature sets that can help develop a highly optimized and stable ensemble trust classifier model. The secondary objective of this study was to investigate how varying levels of risk perception influence users' trust and overall reliance on technology. A within-subject four-condition experiment was implemented with an AV driving game. This experiment involved 25 participants, and their electroencephalogram, electrodermal activity, and facial electromyogram psychophysiological signals were acquired. We applied wrapper, filter, and hybrid feature selection methods on the 82 features extracted from the psychophysiological signals. We trained and tested five voting-based ensemble trust classifier models using training and testing datasets containing only the features identified by the feature selection methods. The results indicate the superiority of the hybrid feature selection method over other methods in terms of model performance. In addition, the self-reported trust measurement and overall reliance of participants on the technology (AV) measured with joystick movements throughout the game reveals that a reduction in risk results in an increase in trust and overall reliance on technology.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3459745,3,,,,,,,Ighoyota Ben Ajenaghughrure and Sonia Cláudia Da Costa Sousa and David Lamas,10.1145/3459745,,EICS,Proc.

ID-1814,inproceedings,Understanding the Role of Explanation Modality in AI-assisted Decision-making,"Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have led to a steep rise in the adoption of AI to augment or support human decision-making across domains. There has been an increasing body of work addressing the benefits of model interpretability and explanations to help end-users or other stakeholders decipher the inner workings of the so-called ”black box AI systems”. Yet, little is currently understood about the role of modalities through which explanations can be communicated (e.g., text, visualizations, or audio) to inform, augment, and shape human decision-making. In our work, we address this research gap through the lens of a credibility assessment system. Considering the deluge of information available through various channels, people constantly make decisions while considering the perceived credibility of the information they consume. However, with an increasing information overload, assessing the credibility of the information we encounter is a non-trivial task. To help users in this task, automated credibility assessment systems have been devised as decision support systems in various contexts (e.g., assessing the credibility of news or social media posts). However, for these systems to be effective in supporting users, they need to be trusted and understood. Explanations have been shown to play an essential role in informing users’ reliance on decision support systems. In this paper, we investigate the influence of explanation modalities on an AI-assisted credibility assessment task. We use a between-subjects experiment (N = 375), spanning six different explanation modalities, to evaluate the role of explanation modality on the accuracy of AI-assisted decision outcomes, the perceived system trust among users, and system usability. Our results indicate that explanations play a significant role in shaping users’ reliance on the decision support system and, thereby, the accuracy of decisions made. We found that users performed with higher accuracy while assessing the credibility of statements in the presence of explanations. We also found that users had a significantly harder time agreeing on statement credibility without explanations. With explanations present, text and audio explanations were more effective than graphic explanations. Additionally, we found that combining graphical with text and/or audio explanations were significantly effective. Such combinations of modalities led to a higher user performance than using graphical explanations alone.",https://dl-acm-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3503252.3531311,3,,,,,,,Vincent Robbemond and Oana Inel and Ujwal Gadiraju,10.1145/3503252.3531311,,,,,,,223-233,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3503252.3531311,2022,"New York, NY, USA",

Simultaneously, fake media such as deepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current multimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can detect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to their reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in this work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics, emphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose Continual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the concept of Continual Learning (CL), Representation Learning (RL), and Knowledge Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain adaptation tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets, while effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student model setting.

Our findings show that participants found human saliency maps to be more helpful in explaining AI answers than machine saliency maps, but performance negatively correlated with trust in the AI model and explanations.

ID-1819,inproceedings,A Decision Theoretic Framework for Measuring AI Reliance,"Humans frequently make decisions with the aid of artificially intelligent (AI) systems. A common pattern is for the AI to recommend an action to the human who retains control over the final decision. Researchers have identified ensuring that a human has appropriate reliance on an AI as a critical component of achieving complementary performance. We argue that the current definition of appropriate reliance used in such research lacks formal statistical grounding and can lead to contradictions. We propose a formal definition of reliance, based on statistical decision theory, which separates the concepts of reliance as the probability the decision-maker follows the AI’s recommendation from challenges a human may face in differentiating the signals and forming accurate beliefs about the situation. Our definition gives rise to a framework that can be used to guide the design and interpretation of studies on human-AI complementarity and reliance. Using recent AI-advised decision making studies from literature, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to separate the loss due to mis-reliance from the loss due to not accurately differentiating the signals. We evaluate these losses by comparing to a baseline and a benchmark for complementary performance defined by the expected payoff achieved by a rational decision-maker facing the same decision task as the behavioral decision-makers.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630106.3658901,3,,,,,,,Ziyang Guo and Yifan Wu and Jason D Hartline and Jessica Hullman,10.1145/3630106.3658901,,,,"Machine learning,decision making,rational decision-maker,reliance",,,221-236,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630106.3658901,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1824,inproceedings,A deep learning anomaly detection framework with explainability and robustness,"The prevalence of encrypted Internet traffic has resulted in a pressing need for advanced analysis techniques for traffic analysis and classification. Traditional rule-based and signature-based approaches have been hindered by the introduction of network encryption methods. With the emergence of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), several preliminary works have been developed for anomaly detection in encrypted network traffic. However, complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) models like neural networks lack explainability, limiting the understanding of their predictions. To address this limitation, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged, aiming to provide users with a rationale for understanding AI system outputs and fostering trust. However, existing explainable frameworks still lack comprehensive support for adversarial attacks and defenses. In this paper, we present Montimage AI Platform (MAIP), a new GUI-based deep learning framework for malicious traffic detection and classification combined with its ability of explaining the decision of the model. We employ popular XAI methods to interpret the prediction of the developed deep learning model. Furthermore, we perform adversarial attacks to assess the accountability and robustness of our model via different quantifiable metrics.

ID-1827,inproceedings,Mapping AI ethics: a meso-scale analysis of its charters and manifestos,"The recent years have seen a surge of initiatives with the goal of defining what “ethical” artificial intelligence would or should entail, resulting in the publication of various charters and manifestos discussing AI ethics; these documents originate from academia, AI industry companies, non-profits, regulatory institutions, and the civil society. The contents of such documents vary wildly, from short, vague position statements to verbatims of democratic debates or impact assessment studies. As such, they are a marker of the social world of artificial intelligence, outlining the tenets of different actors, the consensus and dissensus on important goals, and so on. Multiple meta-analyses have focused on qualitatively identifying recurring themes in these documents, highlighting the high polysemy of themes such as transparency or trust, among others. The broad term of “AI ethics” and its guiding principles hide multiple disparities, shaped by our collective imaginations, economic and regulatory incentives, and the pre-existing social and structural power asymmetries; through quantitative analyses, we validate and infirm previous qualitative results. In this paper, we create and present a corpus of charters and manifestos discussing AI ethics through the process of collection and its quantitative analysis using text analysis to shed light on common and distinct vocabularies. Through frequency analysis, hierarchical topic clustering and semantic graph modelling, we show that the charters and manifestos discuss AI ethics along three broad axes: technical documents, regulatory ones, and innovation and business ones. We use our quantitative analysis to back up and nuance previous qualitative results, showing how some themes remain specific while others have fully permeated the space of AI ethics. We document and release our corpus, comprising of 436 documents, charters and manifestos discussing AI ethics. We release the corpus, its datasheet and our analysis, to open the way to further studies and discussions around vocabulary, principles and their evolution, as well as interactions among actors of AI ethics, in order to foster further studies on the topic.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630106.3658545,3,,,,,,,Mélanie Gornet and Simon Delarue and Maria Boritchev and Tiphaine Viard,10.1145/3630106.3658545,,,,"ai ethics,ai ethics manifestos,mesoscale analysis,mesosociology,social worlds",,,127-140,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630106.3658545,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1828,inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and the Purpose of Social Systems,"The law and ethics of Western democratic states have their basis in liberalism. This extends to regulation and ethical discussion of technology and businesses doing data processing. Liberalism relies on the privacy and autonomy of individuals, their ordering through a public market, and, more recently, a measure of equality guaranteed by the state. We argue that these forms of regulation and ethical analysis are largely incompatible with the techno-political and techno-economic dimensions of artificial intelligence. By analyzing liberal regulatory solutions in the form of privacy and data protection, regulation of public markets, and fairness in AI, we expose how the data economy and artificial intelligence have transcended liberal legal imagination. Organizations use artificial intelligence to exceed the bounded rationality of individuals and each other. This has led to the private consolidation of markets and an unequal hierarchy of control operating mainly for the purpose of shareholder value. An artificial intelligence will be only as ethical as the purpose of the social system that operates it. Inspired by the science of artificial life as an alternative to artificial intelligence, we consider data intermediaries: sociotechnical systems composed of individuals associated around collectively pursued purposes. An attention cooperative, that prioritizes its incoming and outgoing data flows, is one model of a social system that could form and maintain its own autonomous purpose.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3461702.3462526,3,,,,,,,Sebastian Benthall and Jake Goldenfein,10.1145/3461702.3462526,,,,"artificial intelligence,cybernetics,economics,intermediaries,liberalism,platforms,privacy",,,3-12,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3461702.3462526,2021,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1833,inproceedings,XAI for Medicine by ChatGPT Code interpreter,"In recent years, with the prevalence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the interpretability of AI outputs has become a significant issue. Especially the interpretability of large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT, has emerged as a major challenge. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the research of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which seeks to elucidate the decision-making processes of AI in a manner that humans can comprehend. In the medical field, where trust and transparency are important, the use of AI becomes challenging when its decisions are unclear. Therefore, XAI techniques become critically important in the medical field. In this study, we propose the prompt named Code Base Prompt (CBP) to make the ChatGPT's decision-making process on medical texts explainable by using the Python code execution function of Chat GPT Code interpreter. In CBP, the medical decision-making algorithm is rewritten as Python code. Moreover, we propose an explainability evaluation system named Medical Algorithm Presentation Criteria (MAPC) for medical algorithm application tasks to medical text. MAPC is evaluated by five factors to align the human understanding process. To compare CBP with a Text Base Prompt (TBP), we conducted an experiment applying the heart failure classification algorithm to heart failure case report texts in three medical articles. With CBP, the results showed that the ChatGPT Code interpreter executed the Python code in all three cases and met all the five MAPC factors. In contrast, with TBP, no Python code execution was observed in any of the three cases, validating only one factor of MAPC.

Traditionally, applications primarily relied on edge computing, closer to data sources. However, today edge computing approaches are outstripped by modern AI demands. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework together with an online decision algorithm based on multi-armed contextual bandits (DroneBandit), for the dynamic allocation of inference tasks between edge and cloud, to increase inference performance. Our test environment consists of a resource-constrained nanodrone equipped with a custom DNN for obstacle detection, able to achieve 80% accuracy and 71% F2-score. DroneBandit runs on the drone and chooses the optimal cutting point for each iteration on the fly. The decision is based on predicted back-end delays (i.e. data transfer and inference time on the cloud) and observed front-end delays (i.e. inference time on the edge). DroneBandit achieves 83% accuracy and 89% Top3 accuracy in predicting the ideal cutting point on simulations. Our framework demonstrates enhanced task allocation adaptability, enabling efficient computation offloading and edge computing reliance in varying network conditions.

Public value is a dynamic concept that encompasses several dimensions. AI itself has evolved quite rapidly in the last few years, especially with the swift escalation of Generative AI. Governments around the world are grappling with how to govern AI, just as technologists ring alarm bells about the future consequences of AI. Our paper extends the debate on AI governance that is focused on ethical values of beneficence to that of economic values of public good. Viewed as a public good, AI use is beyond the control of the creators. Towards this end, the paper examined AI policies in the United States and Europe. We postulate three principles from a public values perspective: (i) ensuring security and privacy of each individual (or entity); (ii) ensuring trust in AI systems is verifiable; and (iii) ensuring fair and balanced AI protocols, wherein the underlying components of data and algorithms are contestable and open to public debate.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3657054.3657086,3,,,,,,,Sukumar Ganapati and Kevin Desouza,10.1145/3657054.3657086,,,,,,,251-257,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3657054.3657086,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

A significant challenge in XAI is catering to diverse users, such as data scientists, domain experts, and end-users. Recent research has started to investigate how users’ characteristics impact interactions with and user experience of explanations, with a view to personalizing XAI. However, are we heading down a rabbit hole by focusing on unimportant details? Our research aimed to investigate how user characteristics are related to using, understanding, and trusting an AI system that provides explanations. Our empirical study with 149 participants who interacted with an XAI system that flagged inappropriate comments showed that very few user characteristics mattered; only age and the personality trait openness influenced actual understanding.

The Impact of an AI-Driven Feedback System on the Quality of Teacher-Created Learning Designs","Given the rising prominence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, understanding its impact on teacher practices is essential. This paper presents an ABAB reversal design study conducted during a teacher training, where an AI-driven feedback system helped 19 teachers to create learning designs. It investigates the impact that the AI-driven feedback had on the quality of designs and assesses pre- and post-training shifts in teachers’ perceptions of the technology. We observed statistical differences between designs crafted without (in phase A1) and with AI (B1). Notably, a small positive influence persisted even after AI withdrawal (A2). This hints that specialized AI algorithms for learning design can assist teachers in effectively achieving their design objectives. Despite noticeable shifts in teachers’ perceived understanding and usefulness of AI, their trust and intention to use remained unchanged. For a successful teacher-AI partnership, future research should explore the long-term impact that AI usage can have on learning design practices and strategies to nurture trust.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3636555.3636862,3,,,,,,,Gerti Pishtari and Edna Sarmiento-Márquez and Mar\'\{\i\}a Jesús Rodr\'\{\i\}guez-Triana and Marlene Wagner and Tobias Ley,10.1145/3636555.3636862,,,,"Artificial Intelligence,Design Analytics,Inquiry-Based Learning,Learning Design,Mobile Learning,Teacher Training",,,145-156,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3636555.3636862,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

The Higher Education sector are offering more courses in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence than ever before. However, there is a lack of research pertaining to best practices for teaching in this complex domain that heavily relies on both computing and mathematical knowledge. We conducted a literature review and qualitative study with students and Higher Education lecturers from a range of educational institutions, with an aim to determine what might constitute best practices in this area in Higher Education. We hypothesised that confidence, mathematics anxiety, and differences in student educational background were key factors here. We then investigated the issues surrounding these and whether they inhibit the acquisition of knowledge and skills pertaining to the theoretical basis of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

However, the realm of FL is not without its challenges. Especially worrisome are adversarial attacks targeting its algorithmic robustness and systemic confidentiality. Moreover, the presence of biases and opacity in prediction outcomes further complicates FL’s broader adoption. Consequently, there is a growing expectation for FL to instill trust. To address this, we chart out a comprehensive road-map for Trustworthy Federated Learning (TFL) and provide an overview of existing efforts across four pivotal dimensions: Privacy &amp; Security, Robustness, Fairness, and Explainability.

ID-1847,inproceedings,"From ""AI"" to Probabilistic Automation: How Does Anthropomorphization of Technical Systems Descriptions Influence Trust?","In this paper we investigate how people’s level of trust (as reported through self-assessment) in so-called “AI” (artificial intelligence) is influenced by anthropomorphizing language in system descriptions. Building on prior work, we define four categories of anthropomorphization (1. Properties of a cognizer, 2. Agency, 3. Biological metaphors, and 4. Properties of a communicator). We use a survey-based approach (n=954) to investigate whether participants are likely to trust one of two (fictitious) “AI” systems by randomly assigning people to see either an anthropomorphized or a de-anthropomorphized description of the systems. We find that participants are no more likely to trust anthropomorphized over de-anthropmorphized product descriptions overall. The type of product or system in combination with different anthropomorphic categories appears to exert greater influence on trust than anthropomorphizing language alone, and age is the only demographic factor that significantly correlates with people’s preference for anthropomorphized or de-anthropomorphized descriptions. When elaborating on their choices, participants highlight factors such as lesser of two evils, lower or higher stakes contexts, and human favoritism as driving motivations when choosing between product A and B, irrespective of whether they saw an anthropomorphized or a de-anthropomorphized description of the product. Our results suggest that “anthropomorphism” in “AI” descriptions is an aggregate concept that may influence different groups differently, and provide nuance to the discussion of whether anthropomorphization leads to higher trust and over-reliance by the general public in systems sold as “AI”.",https://dl-acm-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3630106.3659040,1,1,1,,,,Language/metaphors help build mental models of a system before interacting with it.

ID-1848,inproceedings,Towards a Responsible AI Metrics Catalogue: A Collection of Metrics for AI Accountability,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly through the advent of large-scale generative AI (GenAI) models such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has become a transformative element in contemporary technology. While these models have unlocked new possibilities, they simultaneously present significant challenges, such as concerns over data privacy and the propensity to generate misleading or fabricated content. Current frameworks for Responsible AI (RAI) often fall short in providing the granular guidance necessary for tangible application, especially for Accountability—a principle that is pivotal for ensuring transparent and auditable decision-making, bolstering public trust, and meeting increasing regulatory expectations. This study bridges the Accountability gap by introducing our effort towards a comprehensive metrics catalogue, formulated through a systematic multivocal literature review (MLR) that integrates findings from both academic and grey literature.

However, human decision-makers must accurately discern when to trust the AI. In situations with complementary Human-AI expertise, identifying AI inaccuracies becomes challenging for humans, hindering their ability to rely on the AI only when warranted. Even when AI performance improves post-errors, this inability to assess accuracy can hinder trust recovery. Through two experimental tasks, we investigate trust development, erosion, and recovery during AI-assisted decision-making, examining explicit Trust Repair Strategies (TRSs) – Apology, Denial, Promise, and Model Update. Our participants classified familiar and unfamiliar stimuli with an AI with varying accuracy. We find that participants leveraged AI accuracy in familiar tasks as a heuristic to dynamically calibrate their trust during unfamiliar tasks. Further, once trust in the AI was eroded, trust restored through Model Update surpassed initial trust values, followed by Apology, Promise, and the baseline (no repair), with Denial being least effective. We empirically demonstrate how trust calibration occurs during complementary expertise, highlighting factors influencing the different effectiveness of TRSs despite identical AI accuracy, and offering implications for effectively restoring trust in Human-AI collaborations.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630106.3658924,3,,,,,,,Saumya Pareek and Eduardo Velloso and Jorge Goncalves,10.1145/3630106.3658924,,,,"Human-AI decision-making,complementary expertise,trust development,trust repair",,,546-561,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630106.3658924,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1857,inproceedings,Evaluating Human-Centered AI Explanations: Introduction of an XAI Evaluation Framework for Fact-Checking,"The rapidly increasing amount of online information and the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) make the manual verification of information impractical. Consequently, AI systems are deployed to detect disinformation and deepfakes. Prior studies have indicated that combining AI and human capabilities yields enhanced performance in detecting disinformation. Furthermore, the European Union (EU) AI Act mandates human supervision for AI applications in areas impacting essential human rights, like freedom of speech, necessitating that AI systems be transparent and provide adequate explanations to ensure comprehensibility. Extensive research has been conducted on incorporating explainability (XAI) attributes to augment AI transparency, yet these often miss a human-centric assessment. The effectiveness of such explanations also varies with the user’s prior knowledge and personal attributes. Therefore, we developed a framework for validating XAI features for the collaborative human-AI fact-checking task. The framework allows the testing of XAI features with objective and subjective evaluation dimensions and follows human-centric design principles when displaying information about the AI system to the users. The framework was tested in a crowdsourcing experiment with 433 participants, including 406 crowdworkers and 27 journalists for the collaborative disinformation detection task. The tested XAI features increase the AI system’s perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust. With this publication, the XAI evaluation framework is made open source.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3643491.3660283,3,,,,,,,Vera Schmitt and Balázs Patrik Csomor and Joachim Meyer and Luis-Felipe Villa-Areas and Charlott Jakob and Tim Polzehl and Sebastian Möller,10.1145/3643491.3660283,,,,"Human-centered eXplanations,blind trust in AI systems,objective and subjective evaluation of eXplanations",,,91-100,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3643491.3660283,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1858,article,Anunnaki: A Modular Framework for Developing Trusted Artificial Intelligence,"Trustworthy artificial intelligence (Trusted AI) is of utmost importance when learning-enabled components (LECs) are used in autonomous, safety-critical systems. When reliant on deep learning, these systems need to address the reliability, robustness, and interpretability of learning models. In addition to developing strategies to address these concerns, appropriate software architectures are needed to coordinate LECs and ensure they deliver acceptable behavior even under uncertain conditions. This work describes Anunnaki, a model-driven framework comprising loosely-coupled modular services designed to monitor and manage LECs with respect to Trusted AI assurance concerns when faced with different sources of uncertainty. More specifically, the Anunnaki framework supports the composition of independent, modular services to assess and improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems. The design of Annunaki was guided by several key software engineering principles (e.g., modularity, composabiilty, and reusability) in order to facilitate its use and maintenance to support different aggregate monitoring and assurance analysis tools for LESs and their respective data sets. We demonstrate Anunnaki on two autonomous platforms, a terrestrial rover and an unmanned aerial vehicle. Our studies show how Anunnaki can be used to manage the operations of different autonomous learning-enabled systems with vision-based LECs while exposed to uncertain environmental conditions.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3649453,3,,,,,,,Michael Austin Langford and Sol Zilberman and Betty H C Cheng,10.1145/3649453,1556-4665,,ACM Trans.

This data includes sensitive information about students’ personal information and learning records, so protecting the security of this data becomes critical. The traditional AES encryption algorithm has been widely used, but as computing power increases, the risk of cracking it also increases. Therefore, this article studies an online education big data encryption algorithm based on artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted optimization, focusing on AI technology to help analyze and process large-scale online education data, and the use of AI technology to optimize traditional Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm. The results of the two sets of simulation experiments are as follows: the average cracking success rate after optimization is 0.028%, which is one-fifth of that before optimization, and the encryption time is reduced by about 37 seconds on average.

Designing a reliable AI system to assist precise plant phenotyping begins with high-quality phenotypic feature annotation, which usually involves collaboration between plant scientists and AI specialists. However, due to the high level of diversity in these researchers’ backgrounds, it is likely that they have differing user needs from a fine-grained plant feature annotation system. We conducted semi-structured interviews with eight experienced annotators from diverse backgrounds, and observed how they interact with their preferred annotation system, to elucidate the challenges faced when annotating plant features and identify user needs. We collected qualitative responses to the interview questions, and conducted a quantitative evaluation of the agreement of their annotations on the given images. By analyzing the participants’ behaviors and the collected data, we identified common user needs and derived implications for the design of an AI-assisted annotation system, including providing a range of annotation options, the flexibility to adapt annotations, and functions to help addressing uncertainty.

ID-1861,inproceedings,Unraveling the Impact of Explainability of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content(AIGC) on Design Style Transfer Effects,"The advent of Artificial Intelligence-generated Content(AIGC) has revolutionized the traditional creative activities in the design field, the workflow of which includes idea generation, sketching, solution determination, low-fidelity prototype interaction, detail tuning, high-fidelity prototyping, front-end slicing, and deployment. By contrast, AIGC streamlines the process of design into idea generation, design model prompting, image dataset collection, AIGC tool use, model fine-tuning, and tool optimization. The designer's focus, the subject, and the object of attention have been changed accordingly. Traditional design activities without AIGC focus on realizing individual and team creativity; the ones with AIGC introduce AI models, algorithms, and AI-HMIs as collaborators in the creative process. The quality of the created content is no longer determined by the designer alone due to the involvement of Artificial Intelligence(AI) of in the prediction and decision-making of the created content. There is also a growing need for designers to have a self-explanatory and responsible intelligent system. This study investigates the role of explainability in four AIGC tools and its impact on creative design. It aims to assess how explainability influences user satisfaction and computer vision metrics in the context of style transfer for iOS mobile interface design. The results demonstrate the adaptations and limitations of these AIGC tools. As observed in CycleGAN, a high level of explainability involves various factors, including superior model performance, manageable datasets, extensive fine-tuning of model parameters, user-centered human-computer interaction, explainability results presentation, and input methods. This high degree of explainability leads to the highest levels of user satisfaction and computer vision evaluation. However, it has drawbacks, as it has limited control over design details.AIGC tools with a medium level of explainability, such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, rely on text-to-image cues for user interaction. They scored in the medium range for user satisfaction and computer vision evaluation. These tools rely on system scalability and functional control for explainability. In contrast, the low level of explainability of ""Sense of Everything"" stems from single dataset control and simple user interaction. As a result, it scored low on user satisfaction and computer vision assessments, indicating a need for more controllability and poor-quality content generation. The study also analyzes the impact of computer vision assessment metrics, where SSIM aligns more with users' subjective evaluations than VGG19. The study highlights areas for improving explainability to meet user expectations for higher performance and ease of use of AIGC tools.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3638884.3638910,3,,,,,,,Zhilin Ren and Xiangang Qin and Bixuan Wang,10.1145/3638884.3638910,,,,"Artificial Intelligence Generated Content,Computer Vision Assessment,Explainable Artificial Intelligence,Human-Computer Interaction,Style Transfer,User Satisfaction",,,171-185,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3638884.3638910,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1864,article,Argument Schemes and a Dialogue System for Explainable Planning,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being increasingly deployed in practical applications. However, there is a major concern whether AI systems will be trusted by humans. To establish trust in AI systems, there is a need for users to understand the reasoning behind their solutions. Therefore, systems should be able to explain and justify their output. Explainable AI Planning is a field that involves explaining the outputs, i.e., solution plans produced by AI planning systems to a user. The main goal of a plan explanation is to help humans understand reasoning behind the plans that are produced by the planners. In this article, we propose an argument scheme-based approach to provide explanations in the domain of AI planning. We present novel argument schemes to create arguments that explain a plan and its key elements and a set of critical questions that allow interaction between the arguments and enable the user to obtain further information regarding the key elements of the plan.

On the other hand, despite the multiple benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT), it raises severe security issues. Therefore, it is evident that the presence of efficient intrusion detection mechanisms is critical. Although Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)-based IDS have already demonstrated their detection efficiency, they still suffer from false alarms and explainability issues that do not allow security administrators to trust them completely compared to conventional signature/specification-based IDS. In light of the aforementioned remarks, in this paper, we introduce an AI-powered IDS with explainability functions for the IoT. The proposed IDS relies on ML and DL methods, while the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is used to explain decision-making.

The authors deliberate how metadata creation and enrichment could be improved through Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and explore the practical applications of AI-reliant tools to analyze a large corpus of photographs and create or enrich metadata. The amount of visual data created by digitization efforts is not always followed by the creation of contextual metadata, which is a major problem for archival institutions and their users, as metadata directly affects the accessibility of digitized records. Moreover, the scale of digitization efforts means it is often beyond the scope of archivists and other record managers to individually assess problematic or sensitive images and their metadata. Additionally, existing metadata for photographic and visual records are presenting issues in terms of outdated descriptions or inconsistent contextual information. As more attention is given to the creation of accessible digital content within archival institutions, we argue that too little is being given to the enrichment of record data.

ID-1867,article,Leveraging Simulation Data to Understand Bias in Predictive Models of Infectious Disease Spread,"The spread of infectious diseases is a highly complex spatiotemporal process, difficult to understand, predict, and effectively respond to. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have achieved impressive results in other learning and prediction tasks; however, while many AI solutions are developed for disease prediction, only a few of them are adopted by decision-makers to support policy interventions. Among several issues preventing their uptake, AI methods are known to amplify the bias in the data they are trained on. This is especially problematic for infectious disease models that typically leverage large, open, and inherently biased spatiotemporal data. These biases may propagate through the modeling pipeline to decision-making, resulting in inequitable policy interventions. Therefore, there is a need to gain an understanding of how the AI disease modeling pipeline can mitigate biased input data, in-processing models, and biased outputs. Specifically, our vision is to develop a large-scale micro-simulation of individuals from which human mobility, population, and disease ground-truth data can be obtained. From this complete dataset—which may not reflect the real world—we can sample and inject different types of bias. By using the sampled data in which bias is known (as it is given as the simulation parameter), we can explore how existing solutions for fairness in AI can mitigate and correct these biases and investigate novel AI fairness solutions.

However, end-users may fail to recognize incompetent AI, allowing untrustworthy AI to exaggerate its competence under the guise of transparency to gain unfair advantage over other trustworthy AI. Here, we conducted an experiment with 120 participants to test if untrustworthy AI can deceive end-users to gain their trust. Participants interacted with two AI-based chess engines, trustworthy (competent, fair) and untrustworthy (incompetent, unfair), that coached participants by suggesting chess moves in three games against another engine opponent. We varied coaches' transparency about their competence (with the untrustworthy one always exaggerating its competence). We quantified and objectively measured participants' trust based on how often participants relied on coaches' move recommendations.

Even in the early stages of Health AI, risks and gaps are being identified, like severe underperformance of models for minority groups and catastrophic model failures when input data shift over time. In the face of such gaps, we find inspiration in aviation, a field that went from highly dangerous to largely safe. We draw three main lessons from aviation safety that can apply to Health AI: 1) Build regulatory feedback loops to learn from mistakes and improve practices, 2) Establish a culture of safety and openness where stakeholders have incentives to report failures and communicate across the healthcare system, and 3) Extensively train, retrain, and accredit experts for interacting with Health AI, especially to help address automation bias and foster trust.

ID-1873,inproceedings,A Power Consumption Measurement Method for Large AI-based Intelligent Computing Servers,"Due to the popularity of Large Language Models (LLM) in Artificial Intelligence (AI), computational power demands are increasing significantly. Intelligent computing centers that use LLM have growing rapidly. Conventional power consumption measurement methods for servers primarily rely on SPECpower, which utilizes the Java Development Kit (JDK) of standard Java to estimate server performance. By applying different levels of loads to the central processing unit (CPU)-based components, the method estimates power consumption weighting among various performance levels, from which comprehensive performance-to-power consumption ratio is derived. However, these methods cannot access the performance of the graphics processing unit (GPU). Therefore, they are unsuitable for the power consumption test of AI-based intelligent computing servers where GPU component power consumption is predominant. In response, this paper proposes a power consumption measurement architecture and method for LLM-based intelligent computing servers, to evaluate server performance by executing large models and estimating server power consumption by automatic means. The architecture is flexible and thus is able to observe specific components related to AI operations. It provides a feasible solution for power evaluation for intelligent servers that executes LLMs. Through a large-scale testing on servers from various manufacturers, we proved the method is feasible for LLM-based servers and is effective.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3653081.3653107,3,,,,,,,Haiyun Zhu and Jiaqi Liu and Xianxu Li and Zhiqin Huang and Yong Zhang,10.1145/3653081.3653107,,,,,,,150-155,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3653081.3653107,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

Indeed, while recommendations promoting Trustworthy AI (TAI) exist, they are often high-level statements difficult to translate into concrete implementation strategies. Currently, there is a significant gap between high-level AI ethics principles and low-level concrete practices for AI professionals. To address this challenge, our work presents an experience report where we develop a novel holistic framework for Trustworthy AI — designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice — and report insights from its application in an industrial case study. The framework builds up from the results of a systematic review of the state of the practice as well as a survey and think-aloud interviews with 34 AI practitioners. The framework, unlike most of the ones in literature, is designed to provide actionable guidelines and tools to support different types of stakeholders throughout the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Our goal is to empower AI professionals to confidently navigate the ethical dimensions of TAI through practical insights, ensuring that the vast potential of AI is exploited responsibly for the benefit of society as a whole.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3644815.3644947,3,,,,,,,Maria Teresa Baldassarre and Domenico Gigante and Marcos Kalinowski and Azzurra Ragone,10.1145/3644815.3644947,,,,"artificial intelligence,framework,knowledge base,software engineering,trustworthy AI",,,200-210,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3644815.3644947,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

This paper presents the KONX (CONNECTS) approach, a methodology that leverages semantic web technologies to create a dynamic and comprehensive knowledge graph for advanced predictive models in academic advising. The KONX methodology focuses on harmonizing heterogeneous educational data sources, enabling seamless data querying and manipulation. By incorporating a feedback mechanism, the KONX approach remains adaptable to changes in the academic domain, continuously updating and maintaining its knowledge representation. To practically apply and evaluate the proposed methodology, a prototype was implemented and tested on an experimental case study concerning student outcomes prediction. The implemented prototype includes a graphical SPARQL generator interface to streamline the construction of SPARQL queries in an integrated way. In this way, this paper proposes both a comprehensive XAI methodology and a holistic technological infrastructure for applying the methodology in real-time scenarios. By bridging the gap between AI decision-making and human-comprehensible explanations, the KONX approach enhances transparency and user trust in AI-driven systems in the education sector.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3631908.3631925,3,,,,,,,Omiros Iatrellis and Nicholas Samaras and Charalampos Dervenis and Theodor Panagiotakopoulos,10.1145/3631908.3631925,,,,,,,118-124,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3631908.3631925,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1879,article,"I Know This Looks Bad, But I Can Explain: Understanding When AI Should Explain Actions In Human-AI Teams","Explanation of artificial intelligence (AI) decision-making has become an important research area in human–computer interaction (HCI) and computer-supported teamwork research. While plenty of research has investigated AI explanations with an intent to improve AI transparency and human trust in AI, how AI explanations function in teaming environments remains unclear. Given that a major benefit of AI giving explanations is to increase human trust understanding how AI explanations impact human trust is crucial to effective human-AI teamwork. An online experiment was conducted with 156 participants to explore this question by examining how a teammate’s explanations impact the perceived trust of the teammate and the effectiveness of the team and how these impacts vary based on whether the teammate is a human or an AI. This study shows that explanations facilitate trust in AI teammates when explaining why AI disobeyed humans’ orders but hindered trust when explaining why an AI lied to humans. In addition, participants’ personal characteristics (e.g., their gender and the individual’s ethical framework) impacted their perceptions of AI teammates both directly and indirectly in different scenarios. Our study contributes to interactive intelligent systems and HCI by shedding light on how an AI teammate’s actions and corresponding explanations are perceived by humans while identifying factors that impact trust and perceived effectiveness. This work provides an initial understanding of AI explanations in human-AI teams, which can be used for future research to build upon in exploring AI explanation implementation in collaborative environments.",https://dl-acm-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3635474,1,1,1,,,,"""Imagine you are playing a multiplayer online game.

ID-1880,article,AI Tax: The Hidden Cost of AI Data Center Applications,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are experiencing widespread adoption in industry and academia. This has been driven by rapid advances in the applications and accuracy of AI through increasingly complex algorithms and models; this, in turn, has spurred research into specialized hardware AI accelerators. Given the rapid pace of advances, it is easy to forget that they are often developed and evaluated in a vacuum without considering the full application environment. This article emphasizes the need for a holistic, end-to-end analysis of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads and reveals the “AI tax.” We deploy and characterize Face Recognition in an edge data center. The application is an AI-centric edge video analytics application built using popular open source infrastructure and machine learning (ML) tools. Despite using state-of-the-art AI and ML algorithms, the application relies heavily on pre- and post-processing code. As AI-centric applications benefit from the acceleration promised by accelerators, we find they impose stresses on the hardware and software infrastructure: storage and network bandwidth become major bottlenecks with increasing AI acceleration. By specializing for AI applications, we show that a purpose-built edge data center can be designed for the stresses of accelerated AI at 15% lower TCO than one derived from homogeneous servers and infrastructure.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3440689,3,,,,,,,Daniel Richins and Dharmisha Doshi and Matthew Blackmore and Aswathy Thulaseedharan Nair and Neha Pathapati and Ankit Patel and Brainard Daguman and Daniel Dobrijalowski and Ramesh Illikkal and Kevin Long and David Zimmerman and Vijay Janapa Reddi,10.1145/3440689,0734-2071,1–4,ACM Trans.

ID-1881,inproceedings,Exploring potential implications of intelligent tools for human aspects of software engineering,"Background. The emergence of tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) to support software development suggests an overhaul on how developers program and interact among themselves. This disruption might bring challenges regarding human and social aspects of the software development process. Objective. This paper is a first exploration of the consequences of AI-based tools for software development teams and their members. Method. We conducted a social science fiction exercise, a sort of thought experiment, narrating two fictional stories about a futuristic software company employing AI-based tools. Then, we evaluated the plausibility of one of the scenarios through a qualitative experiment with 38 students to observe their perception regarding the use of AI-based tools. Results. The stories suggest potential challenges related to the adoption of these tools: a change on how developers perceive themselves, a clash between quantitative and qualitative worker contribution assessment, and the training of future developers to handle the imminent changes on their profession. In the qualitative experiment, we collected evidence supporting negative feelings, such as lack of trust and control and fear of being replaced. We also identified other attitudes and perceptions of developers, such as positive feelings towards AI-based tools. Conclusion. We identified several aspects that might influence the adoption of AI-based tools and their implications for individuals involved. They should be further investigated and represent a challenge for the research on human aspects of software engineering.

ID-1882,inproceedings,A hierarchical AI-based control plane solution for multi-technology deterministic networks,"Following the Industry 4.0 vision of a full digitization of the industry, time-critical services and applications, allowing network infrastructures to deliver information with determinism and reliability, are becoming more and more relevant for a set of vertical sectors. As a consequence, deterministic network solutions are progressively emerging, albeit they are still bounded to specific technological domains. Even considering the existence of interconnected deterministic networks, the provision of an end-to-end (E2E) deterministic service over them must rely on a specific control plane architecture, capable of seamlessly integrate and control the underlying multi-technology data plane. In this work, we envision such a control plane solution, extending previous works and exploiting several innovations and novel architectural concepts. The proposed control architecture is service-centric, in order to provide the necessary flexibility, scalability, and modularity to deal with a heterogenous data plane. The architecture is hierarchical and encompasses a set of management platforms to interact with specific network technologies overarched by an E2E platform for the management, monitoring, and control of E2E deterministic services.

ID-1884,inproceedings,"Ten regulatory principles to scaffold the design, manufacture, and use of trustworthy autonomous systems, illustrated in a maritime context","Autonomous systems are increasingly prevalent around the world, with the benefits related to safety, efficiency, and sustainability attractive in addition to the opportunity to establish entirely new capabilities. In order to operationalise autonomous systems technology it is critical to have in place the legal, regulatory and ethical infrastructure necessary to enable safe and trusted operation. While there is a growing body of literature regarding ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI), there is a need for more academic exploration of legal and regulatory best practice for autonomous systems used in commercial and defence contexts. This paper addresses that literature gap by considering the role of regulation and its relationship with trust in a multi-disciplinary context, before proposing 10 principles to base regulatory development and implementation on. These principles, Trust-centred; Collaborative; Risk-based; Evidence-led; Facilitate experimentation; Systems-focussed; Usable; Consistent; Adaptable and Reviewable, collectively provide a domain and technology agnostic basis for a regulatory framework development and implementation approach that supports the design, manufacture and operation of safe and trusted autonomous systems.

ID-1887,inproceedings,An Instrument for Measuring Teachers’ Trust in AI-Based Educational Technology,"Evidence from various domains underlines the key role that human factors, and especially, trust, play in the adoption of technology by practitioners. In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven learning analytics tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners’ AI-specific misconceptions, myths, and fears (i.e., mass unemployment and ethical concerns). In recent years, artificial intelligence has been introduced increasingly into K-12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K-12 teachers regarding the use and adoption of AI-based Educational Technology (EdTech). The present study introduces a new instrument to measure teachers’ trust in AI-based EdTech, provides evidence of its internal structure validity, and uses it to portray secondary-level school teachers’ attitudes toward AI. First, we explain the instrument items creation process based on our preliminary research and review of existing tools in other domains. Second, using Exploratory Factor Analysis we analyze the results from 132 teachers’ input. The results reveal eight factors influencing teachers’ trust in adopting AI-based EdTech: Perceived Benefits of AI-based EdTech, AI-based EdTech’s Lack of Human Characteristics, AI-based EdTech’s Perceived Lack of Transparency, Anxieties Related to Using AI-based EdTech, Self-efficacy in Using AI-based EdTech, Required Shift in Pedagogy to Adopt AI-based EdTech, Preferred Means to Increase Trust in AI-based EdTech, and AI-based EdTech vs Human Advice/Recommendation. Finally, we use the instrument to discuss 132 high-school Biology teachers’ responses to the survey items and to what extent they align with the findings from the literature in relevant domains. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, it introduces a reliable instrument to investigate the role of teachers’ trust in AI-based EdTech and the factors influencing it. Second, the findings from the teachers’ survey can guide creators of teacher professional development courses and policymakers on improving teachers’ trust in, and in turn their willingness to adopt, AI-based EdTech in K-12 education.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3506860.3506866,3,,,,,,,Tanya Nazaretsky and Mutlu Cukurova and Giora Alexandron,10.1145/3506860.3506866,,,,"AI,Blended Learning,Human Factors,K-12 Education,Teachers,Trust",,,56-66,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3506860.3506866,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1888,article,How Do Users Experience Traceability of AI Systems? Examining Subjective Information Processing Awareness in Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) Systems,"When interacting with artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical domain, users frequently face automated information processing, which can remain opaque to them. For example, users with diabetes may interact daily with automated insulin delivery (AID). However, effective AID therapy requires traceability of automated decisions for diverse users. Grounded in research on human-automation interaction, we study Subjective Information Processing Awareness (SIPA) as a key construct to research users’ experience of explainable AI. The objective of the present research was to examine how users experience differing levels of traceability of an AI algorithm. We developed a basic AID simulation to create realistic scenarios for an experiment with N&nbsp;= 80, where we examined the effect of three levels of information disclosure on SIPA and performance. Attributes serving as the basis for insulin needs calculation were shown to users, who predicted the AID system’s calculation after over 60 observations. Results showed a difference in SIPA after repeated observations, associated with a general decline of SIPA ratings over time. Supporting scale validity, SIPA was strongly correlated with trust and satisfaction with explanations. The present research indicates that the effect of different levels of information disclosure may need several repetitions before it manifests. Additionally, high levels of information disclosure may lead to a miscalibration between SIPA and performance in predicting the system’s results. The results indicate that for a responsible design of XAI, system designers could utilize prediction tasks in order to calibrate experienced traceability.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3588594,3,,,,,,,Tim Schrills and Thomas Franke,10.1145/3588594,2160-6455,4,ACM Trans.

ID-1889,article,The Image Calculator: 10x Faster Image-AI Inference by Replacing JPEG with Self-designing Storage Format,"Numerous applications today rely on artificial intelligence over images. Image AI is, however, extremely expensive. In particular, the inference cost of image AI dominates the end-to-end cost. We observe that the image storage format lies at the root of the problem. Images today are predominantly stored in JPEG format. JPEG is a storage format designed for the human eye; it maximally compresses images without distorting the components of an image that are visible to the human eye. However, our observation is that during image AI, images are ""seen'' by algorithms, not humans. In addition, every AI application is different regarding which data components of the images are the most relevant.We present the Image Calculator, a self-designing image storage format that adapts to the given AI task, i.e., the specific neural network, the dataset, and the applications' specific accuracy, inference time, and storage requirements. Contrary to the state-of-the-art, the Image Calculator does not use a fixed storage format like JPEG. Instead, it designs and constructs a new storage format tailored to the context. It does so by constructing a massive design space of candidate storage formats from first principles, within which it searches efficiently using composite performance models (inference time, accuracy, storage). This way, it leverages the given AI task's unique characteristics to compress the data maximally. We evaluate the Image Calculator across a diverse set of data, image analysis tasks, AI models, and hardware. We show that the Image Calculator can generate image storage formats that reduce inference time by up to 14.2x and storage by up to 8.2x with a minimal loss in accuracy or gain, compared to JPEG and its state-of-the-art variants.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3639307,3,,,,,,,Utku Sirin and Stratos Idreos,10.1145/3639307,,1,Proc.

ID-1890,inproceedings,Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Evidence-Based Decision Making in Government: Random Forest and Deep Neural Network Classification for Predicting Harmful Algal Blooms in New York State,"Advances in artificial intelligence techniques have shown tremendous potential as a decision support tool for government agencies. However, recent studies typically highlight the combination of large-scale datasets and high-performance computing technologies, which is frequently far away from the reality of many public agencies that still heavily rely on their legacy systems and labor-intensive practices. Using that non-ideal organizational and technical infrastructure, they have to face very complex problems and propose policy solutions. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are one of such problems. HABs have increasingly become a serious environmental issue in the United States. However, the rapid and sporadic growth of algae and the current standard relying on manual sampling weaken the agencies' response. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we attempt to bridge advanced AI technologies and current government practice by examining the potential of artificial intelligence by comparing the performance of linear probability, random forest, and deep neural network algorithms in predicting HABs with manual sampling data. By integrating manually-sampled HABs data with predictors from publicly-available datasets (land use, weather, and drought), we demonstrate that random forest and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms improve the specificity of the prediction, increasing the true negative rate. Albeit not ideal, we believe that this approach can benefit public agencies that are forced to respond to HABs with limited resources for investing in improving legacy systems. Accurate prediction with limited data could still be useful for certain government decisions, even when the mechanisms of causality are not totally clear. AI techniques have the potential to improve these predictive capabilities.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3463677.3463713,3,,,,,,,Yongjin Choi and Ramon Gil-Garcia and Oguz Aranay and Brian Burke and Derek Werthmuller,10.1145/3463677.3463713,,,,"artificial intelligence,deep neural network,evidence based policy,harmful algal blooms,random forest",,,27-37,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3463677.3463713,2021,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1891,article,"A NetAI Manifesto (Part II): Less Hubris, more Humility","The application of the latest techniques from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to improve and automate the decision-making required for solving real-world network security and performance problems (NetAI, for short) has generated great excitement among networking researchers. However, network operators have remained very reluctant when it comes to deploying NetAIbased solutions in their production networks. In Part I of this manifesto, we argue that to gain the operators' trust, researchers will have to pursue a more scientific approach towards NetAI than in the past that endeavors the development of explainable and generalizable learning models. In this paper, we go one step further and posit that this ""opening up of NetAI research"" will require that the largely self-assured hubris about NetAI gives way to a healthy dose humility. Rather than continuing to extol the virtues and ""magic"" of black-box models that largely obfuscate the critical role of the utilized data play in training these models, concerted research efforts will be needed to design NetAI-driven agents or systems that can be expected to perform well when deployed in production settings and are also required to exhibit strong robustness properties when faced with ambiguous situations and real-world uncertainties. We describe one such effort that is aimed at developing a new ML pipeline for generating trained models that strive to meet these expectations and requirements.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3626570.3626610,3,,,,,,,Walter Willinger and Arpit Gupta and Roman Beltiukov and Wenbo Guo,10.1145/3626570.3626610,0163-5999,2,SIGMETRICS Perform.

ID-1892,inproceedings,From GenAI to Political Profiling Avatars: A Data-Driven Approach to Crafting Virtual Experts for Voting Advice Applications,"Voting advice applications (VAAs) are pivotal web-based tools that guide citizens to align with political parties and candidates that match their preferences. Traditional methods for creating candidate profiles predominantly rely on questionnaire responses, a time-intensive and costly process. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-centric methodology utilizing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), culminating in creating political avatars. These political avatars are engineered using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 and Bard. They are adept at processing and interpreting data primarily sourced from Twitter and leveraging bespoke, self-trained datasets. Integrating advanced AI technology with diverse data sources equips political avatars with unprecedented analytical and predictive capabilities, setting a new standard in political analysis. Unlike traditional methods, political avatars are adept at emulating the responses of real politicians or experts, showcasing a remarkable capacity to interact with VAA surveys. This novel approach presents the potential to either compete with or enhance the insights traditionally obtained from human experts. Another critical aspect of our study is comparing political avatars and previous research employing question-answering (QA) models based on advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for political profiling. This comparative analysis reveals that Political Avatars offer a significantly more robust solution for profile construction. While QA models provide structured responses based on specific queries, political avatars bring an element of dynamism and depth, capable of generating nuanced, context-aware responses. This shift from static, questionnaire-based profiling to dynamic, AI-driven avatars marks a substantial leap in political analysis. Generative AI in crafting Political Avatars introduces a transformative element to data analysis. This approach facilitates a layered and more sophisticated interpretation of political stances, moving beyond the limitations of traditional profiling methods. By employing political avatars, our methodology not only streamlines the profiling process but also enriches the quality of insights derived, paving the way for a more nuanced understanding of the political landscape.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3657054.3657092,3,,,,,,,José Alberto Mancera Andrade and Luis Terán,10.1145/3657054.3657092,,,,"Bard,GPT-4,Generative AI,Large Language Models,Natural Language Processing,Political Avatars,Question Answering,Social Media,Voting Advice Applications",,,305-311,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3657054.3657092,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1893,article,Adversarial Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Traffic Signal Control Systems with Colluding Vehicles,"The rapid advancements of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have catalyzed the development of adaptive traffic control systems (ATCS) for smart cities. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models produce state-of-the-art performance and have great potential for practical applications. In the existing DRL-based ATCS, the controlled signals collect traffic state information from nearby vehicles, and then optimal actions (e.g., switching phases) can be determined based on the collected information. The DRL models fully “trust” that vehicles are sending the true information to the traffic signals, making the ATCS vulnerable to adversarial attacks with falsified information. In view of this, this article first time formulates a novel task in which a group of vehicles can cooperatively send falsified information to “cheat” DRL-based ATCS in order to save their total travel time. To solve the proposed task, we develop CollusionVeh, a generic and effective vehicle-colluding framework composed of a road situation encoder, a vehicle interpreter, and a communication mechanism. We employ our framework to attack established DRL-based ATCS and demonstrate that the total travel time for the colluding vehicles can be significantly reduced with a reasonable number of learning episodes, and the colluding effect will decrease if the number of colluding vehicles increases. Additionally, insights and suggestions for the real-world deployment of DRL-based ATCS are provided. The research outcomes could help improve the reliability and robustness of the ATCS and better protect the smart mobility systems.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3625236,3,,,,,,,Ao Qu and Yihong Tang and Wei Ma,10.1145/3625236,2157-6904,6,ACM Trans.

This language is a linguistically different&nbsp; created in the region. Recently, researchers in handwriting detection studies comparing with indigenous languages are attained important internet amongst research community. A new development of artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), cognitive analytics, and computational linguistics (CL) find it helpful in the analysis of regional low resource languages. It can be obvious in the obtainability of effectual machine detection methods and open access handwritten databases. Tamil is most ancient Indian language that is mostly exploited in Southern part of India, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia. Tamil handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) is a critical procedure in optical character detection. Therefore, this study designs a Henry Gas Solubility Optimization with Deep Learning based Handwriting Recognition Model (HGSODL-HRM) for Asian Indigenous Language Processing. The proposed HGSODL-HRM technique relies on computer vision and DL concepts for automated handwriting recognition in Tamil language, which is one of the popular indigenous languages in Asia. To accomplish this, the HGSODL-HRM technique employs capsule network (CapsNet) model for feature vector generation with HGSO algorithm as a hyperparameter optimizer. For the recognition of handwritten characters, wavelet neural network (WNN) model is exploited. Finally, the WNN parameters can be optimally chosen by sail fish optimizer (SFO) algorithm. To demonstrate the promising results of the HGSODL-HRM system, an extensive range of simulations can be implemented.

ID-1898,inproceedings,"Towards a Semantic Approach for Linked Dataspace, Model and Data Cards","The vast majority of artificial intelligence practitioners overlook the importance of documentation when building and publishing models and datasets. However, due to the recent trend in the explainability and fairness of AI models, several frameworks have been proposed such as Model Cards, and Data Cards, among others, to help in the appropriate re-usage of those models and datasets. In addition, because of the introduction of the dataspace concept for similar datasets in one place, there is potential that similar Model Cards, Data Cards, Service Cards, and Dataspace Cards can be linked to extract helpful information for better decision-making about which model and data can be used for a specific application. This paper reviews the case for considering a Semantic Web approach for exchanging Model/Data Cards as Linked Data or knowledge graphs in a dataspace, making them machine-readable. We discuss the basic concepts and propose a schema for linking Data Cards and Model Cards within a dataspace. In addition, we introduce the concept of a dataspace card which can be a starting point for extracting knowledge about models and datasets in a dataspace.

The actors of this emergent practice are coming from contemporary art, media and digital arts. These artists have developed an original practice of AI within their creative field. In this article, we propose a qualitative study to explore the nature of this practice. We interviewed five internationally renowned artists about how AI is integrated into their work. Through a thematic analysis of the interviews, we first find that their practice relies on crafting algorithms and data as materials. We uncover how they explicitly use this material unpredictability rather than avoid it. Secondly, we highlight the politics of their practice that consist of resisting the culture of AI research, as well as its inherent power dynamics. We also highlight how their relationship with the technology is imbued with ethics and how they rethink their role with respect to the technology.

ID-1900,inproceedings,Design-Space Exploration of Systolic Array for Edge Inferencing Applications,"Systolic array&nbsp;(SA) architectures are suitable hardware accelerators to run artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI) algorithms due to their scalable and pipelined structure. Inferencing on edge devices enables decision-making capability in a small, power-efficient form factor suitable for many IoT-based applications. Convolutional neural networks&nbsp;(CNNs), which form a major part of AI algorithms, are generally memory and compute-intensive algorithms. Optimizing resource-constrained SA-based edge-computing system architecture is crucial. The primary challenge is to find an optimal SA configuration with sufficient on-chip and off-chip memory, processing elements, and optimal memory-bandwidth interface for achieving minimum latency and stall cycles while maximizing compute utilization and mapping efficiency. This work characterizes the popular ResNet50 CNN model on different SA architecture configurations that are structured using a realistic designer tool SCALE-SIM. The design-space exploration of SA was carried out to run the Resnet50 model by configuring i) array sizes (processing elements matrix), ii) SRAM memory sizes available to the computing elements, iii) varying interface bandwidth of memory to the computing elements. The compute latency in clock cycles, SA utilization, Mapping efficiency, number of Stall cycles, and SRAM and DRAM bandwidth requirements were extracted using cycle accurate runs. All three types of data-flow models, including output stationary&nbsp;(OS), weight stationary&nbsp;(WS), and input stationary&nbsp;(IS), were investigated in this work. Unlike previous research that relied on benchmarking various mathematical models, this study focuses on characterizing SA configurations using the ResNet50 model.

ID-1902,inproceedings,Invigorating Ubuntu Ethics in AI for healthcare: Enabling equitable care,"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the potential to improve patient outcomes and increase efficiency in the delivery of care. However, the design, deployment and use of AI in healthcare must be guided by a set of ethical principles that prioritize the well-being of patients and the community, and ensure that care is delivered equitably. A growing body of literature on algorithmic injustice illustrates that AI systems in healthcare have the potential to cause social harm, especially to vulnerable communities. Existing ethical principles in healthcare are based on, and mostly influenced by, Western epistemology, which emphasizes individual rights, often at the expense of collective well-being. The African philosophy of Ubuntu, which emphasises the interconnectedness and interdependence of all people, is an attractive framework for addressing ethical concerns in AI for healthcare because healthcare is intrinsically a community-wide issue. This paper discusses the relevance of Ubuntu ethics in the context of AI for healthcare and proposes principles to reinvigorate the spirit of “I am because we are” in design, deployment and use. These principles are fairness, community good, safeguarding humanity, respect for others and trust, and we believe their application will support co-designing, deploying and using inclusive AI systems that will enable clinicians to deliver equitable care for all. Highlighting the relational aspect of Ubuntu, this paper not only calls for rethinking AI ethics in healthcare but also endorses discussions about the need for non-Western ethical approaches to be utilised in AI ethics more broadly.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3593013.3594024,3,,,,,,,Lameck Mbangula Amugongo and Nicola J Bidwell and Caitlin C Corrigan,10.1145/3593013.3594024,,,,"algorithmic fairness,algorithmic trust,equitable care,relational ethics",,,583-592,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3593013.3594024,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

The introduction of artificial intelligence as a supplementary diagnostic method can effectively reduce the cost of screening for fundus diseases. The scarcity of abnormal fundus photos and the black-box nature of deep learning have hindered the implementation and application of AI-assisted diagnosis. In this study, we propose a deep mining method for fundus disease information based on a heat map. The method incorporates the gradient calculation idea of CAM and the detection process of FastFlow. Only normal fundus photo images are learned during training and are no longer limited to abnormal fundus photos. By extracting features from the input fundus photo images, calculating the gradient matrix and probability map, and outputting the heat map and predicted mask, the model can achieve segmentation of abnormal regions and present the important features in the fundus photo images to the doctor, enabling the doctor not only to obtain the prediction results of the model, but also to judge whether the results given by the model are reliable based on the inference basis of the model, and to give the final treatment decision after referring to the model The final treatment decision is made after referring to the model's diagnostic results.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3592686.3592741,3,,,,,,,Ziyan Shen and Xiaoyu Jiang and Xiaoling Huang,10.1145/3592686.3592741,,,,,,,305-309,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3592686.3592741,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

Different training methods were used to establish a rapport between the human and AI players. Overall, despite answering correctly, participants were increasingly more likely to say they had made a mistake and that they were to blame as the difficulty of the game increased.

To answer these questions, we co-developed and documented three projects at YR Media, a national network of youth journalists and artists who create multimedia for public distribution. Participants are predominantly youth of color and those contending with economic and other barriers to full participation in STEM fields. Findings showed that by creating a learning ecology that centered the cultures and experiences of its learners while leveraging familiar tools for critical analysis, youth deepened their understanding of AI.

ID-1910,inproceedings,Digital Twin Virtualization with Machine Learning for IoT and Beyond 5G Networks: Research Directions for Security and Optimal Control,"Digital twin (DT) technologies have emerged as a solution for real-time data-driven modeling of cyber physical systems (CPS) using the vast amount of data available by Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In this position paper, we elucidate unique characteristics and capabilities of a DT framework that enables realization of such promises as online learning of a physical environment, real-time monitoring of assets, Monte Carlo heuristic search for predictive prevention, on-policy, and off-policy reinforcement learning in real-time. We establish a conceptual layered architecture for a DT framework with decentralized implementation on cloud computing and enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) services for modeling and decision-making processes. The DT framework separates the control functions, deployed as a system of logically centralized process, from the physical devices under control, much like software-defined networking (SDN) in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. To clarify the significance of DT in lowering the risk of development and deployment of innovative technologies on existing system, we discuss the application of implementing zero trust architecture (ZTA) as a necessary security framework in future data-driven communication networks.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3522783.3529519,3,,,,,,,Jithin Jagannath and Keyvan Ramezanpour and Anu Jagannath,10.1145/3522783.3529519,,,,"5g,data-driven modeling,digital twin,distributed control,intelligent controller,real-time monitoring",,,81-86,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3522783.3529519,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1911,article,ThermoSecure: Investigating the Effectiveness of AI-Driven Thermal Attacks on Commonly Used Computer Keyboards,"Thermal cameras can reveal heat traces on user interfaces, such as keyboards. This can be exploited maliciously to infer sensitive input, such as passwords. While previous work considered thermal attacks that rely on visual inspection of simple image processing techniques, we show that attackers can perform more effective artificial intelligence (AI)–driven attacks. We demonstrate this by presenting the development of ThermoSecure and its evaluation in two user studies (N = 21, N = 16), which reveal novel insights about thermal attacks. We detail the implementation of ThermoSecure and make a dataset of 1,500 thermal images of keyboards with heat traces resulting from input publicly available. Our first study shows that ThermoSecure successfully attacks 6-symbol, 8-symbol, 12-symbol, and 16-symbol passwords with an average accuracy of 92%, 80%, 71%, and 55% respectively, and even higher accuracy when thermal images are taken within 30 seconds. We found that typing behavior significantly impacts vulnerability to thermal attacks: hunt-and-peck typists are more vulnerable than fast typists (92% vs. 83% thermal attack success. respectively, if performed within 30 seconds). The second study showed that keycap material has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of thermal attacks: ABS keycaps retain the thermal trace of user presses for a longer period of time, making them more vulnerable to thermal attacks, with a 52% average attack accuracy compared with 14% for keyboards with PBT keycaps. Finally, we discuss how systems can leverage our results to protect from thermal attacks and present 7 mitigation approaches that are based on our results and previous work.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3563693,3,,,,,,,Norah Alotaibi and John Williamson and Mohamed Khamis,10.1145/3563693,2471-2566,2,ACM Trans.

We describe a qualitative study examining CHWs’ perceptions of an AI application for automated disease diagnosis. Drawing on data from 21 interviews with CHWs in rural India, we characterize (1) CHWs’ knowledge, perceptions, and understandings of AI; and (2) the benefits and challenges that CHWs anticipate as AI applications are integrated into their workflows, including their opinions on automation of their work, possible misdiagnosis and errors, data access and surveillance issues, security and privacy challenges, and questions concerning trust.

ID-1913,article,On the Importance of User Backgrounds and Impressions: Lessons Learned from Interactive AI Applications,"While EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches aim to improve human-AI collaborative decision-making by improving model transparency and mental model formations, experiential factors associated with human users can cause challenges in ways system designers do not anticipate. In this article, we first showcase a user study on how anchoring bias can potentially affect mental model formations when users initially interact with an intelligent system and the role of explanations in addressing this bias. Using a video activity recognition tool in cooking domain, we asked participants to verify whether a set of kitchen policies are being followed, with each policy focusing on a weakness or a strength. We controlled the order of the policies and the presence of explanations to test our hypotheses. Our main finding shows that those who observed system strengths early on were more prone to automation bias and made significantly more errors due to positive first impressions of the system, while they built a more accurate mental model of the system competencies. However, those who encountered weaknesses earlier made significantly fewer errors, since they tended to rely more on themselves, while they also underestimated model competencies due to having a more negative first impression of the model. Motivated by these findings and similar existing work, we formalize and present a conceptual model of user’s past experiences that examine the relations between user’s backgrounds, experiences, and human factors in XAI systems based on usage time.

ID-1914,inproceedings,The Conflict Between Explainable and Accountable Decision-Making Algorithms,"Decision-making algorithms are being used in important decisions, such as who should be enrolled in health care programs and be hired. Even though these systems are currently deployed in high-stakes scenarios, many of them cannot explain their decisions. This limitation has prompted the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) initiative, which aims to make algorithms explainable to comply with legal requirements, promote trust, and maintain accountability. This paper questions whether and to what extent explainability can help solve the responsibility issues posed by autonomous AI systems. We suggest that XAI systems that provide post-hoc explanations could be seen as blameworthy agents, obscuring the responsibility of developers in the decision-making process. Furthermore, we argue that XAI could result in incorrect attributions of responsibility to vulnerable stakeholders, such as those who are subjected to algorithmic decisions (i.e., patients), due to a misguided perception that they have control over explainable algorithms. This conflict between explainability and accountability can be exacerbated if designers choose to use algorithms and patients as moral and legal scapegoats. We conclude with a set of recommendations for how to approach this tension in the socio-technical process of algorithmic decision-making and a defense of hard regulation to prevent designers from escaping responsibility.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3531146.3534628,3,,,,,,,Gabriel Lima and Nina Grgić-Hlača and Jin Keun Jeong and Meeyoung Cha,10.1145/3531146.3534628,,,,"AI,Accountability,Algorithms,Artificial Intelligence,Blame,Decision-Making,Designers,Explainability,Patients,Responsibility,Users",,,2103-2113,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3531146.3534628,2022,"New York, NY, USA",

In Healthcare applications, relying on both IoT and AI requires paying attention to latency, responsiveness and management of data loads. Most of the healthcare applications are based on Cloud computing and use Cloud platforms such as Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. With the increased adoption of IoT in various domains, the data generation rate and volume by IoT devices has tremendously increased, making the Cloud insufficient for latency sensitive healthcare applications. Fog computing, complementing the Cloud services, can be deployed close to the data source to better utilize distributed resources and meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of healthcare application. In this paper, we propose a Fog-based cardiac health detection framework, called FogDLearner. FogDLearner utilizes distributed resources to diagnose cardiac health of a person without compromising QoS and accuracy. FogDLearner uses a deep learning based classifier to predict the cardiac health of the user. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the PureEdgeSim simulator, in terms of resource utilization under overload and under-load scenarios, mobility support, and power consumption.

ID-1918,inproceedings,Optimizing GPU deep learning operators with polyhedral scheduling constraint injection,"Automatic parallel code generation from high-level abstractions such as those manipulated by artificial intelligence and deep learning (AI/DL) frameworks heavily rely on compiler techniques for automatic parallelization and optimization. Many recent advances rely on the polyhedral framework for this task because of its ability to model and to apply a wide range of loop transformations. However, modeling the complexity of the target architecture and of efficient cost models to decide about the best transformation is in general out of reach for a framework based on linear/affine constraints. In this work, we propose to decouple the polyhedral framework into linear and non-linear components. We introduce the constraint tree abstraction which may be generated by a non-linear optimizer and injected to the polyhedral optimization process to build better solutions. We present how to benefit from such a mechanism to generate efficient codes for GPU in the context of AI/DL operators. Our constraint injection allows to drive the polyhedral scheduler towards efficient solutions for load/store vectorization relying both on memory coalescing and vector types. We implemented our scheduler supporting constraint injection and our constraint construction system within a production AI/DL framework.

In this paper, we experiment how adversarial scenario may impact the security of machine learning based mechanisms such as email spam filters. Using natural language processing (NLP) and Baysian model as an example, we developed and tested three invasive techniques, i.e., synonym replacement, ham word injection and spam word spacing.

Thus, this research focuses on the applications of FinTech and DL in asset allocation and aims to optimize investment portfolio. The best investment portfolio in index-based funds based on Taiwan's index-type security investment trust funds are the main investment targets. Time series models for DL, that is, long short-term memory, predict the increase of each investment target and find the best investment portfolio in combination with the relevant asset allocation theory. In this research, we use the Markowitz mean-variance and Black-Litterman models as our asset allocation models for robo-advisor. Results show that the Black-Litterman model has a better accumulated return performance than the Morkowitz model and outperforms other strategies.

ID-1922,inproceedings,Contrastive Counterfactual Fairness in Algorithmic Decision-Making,"The widespread use of artificial intelligence algorithms and their role in decision-making with consequential decisions for human subjects has resulted in a growing interest in designing AI algorithms accounting for fairness considerations. There have been attempts to account for fairness of AI algorithms without compromising their accuracy to improve poorly designed algorithms that disregard sensitive attributes (e.g., age, race, and gender) at the peril of introducing or increasing bias against specific groups. Although many studies have examined the optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy, it remains a challenge to understand the sources of unfairness in decision-making and mitigate it effectively. To tackle this problem, researchers have proposed fair causal learning approaches which assist us in modeling cause and effect knowledge structures, discovering bias sources, and refining AI algorithms to make them more transparent and explainable. In this study, we formalize probabilistic interpretations of both contrastive and counterfactual causality as essential features in order to encourage users' trust and to expand the applicability of such automated systems. We use this formalism to define a novel fairness criterion that we call contrastive counterfactual fairness. This paper introduces, to the best of our knowledge, the first probabilistic fairness-aware data augmentation approach that is based on contrastive counterfactual causality. We tested our approach on two well-known fairness-related datasets, UCI Adult and German Credit, and concluded that our proposed method has a promising ability to capture and mitigate unfairness in AI deployment.

AI helps people support and automate decision-making penetrating almost all daily life aspects and research areas. One of the reasons for this potential is that AI helps us solve problems at a lower cost of resources and time. Materials research acceleration often relies upon AI using and automation of laboratory experiments, bringing significant fruitful results and advances. Self-driving laboratories include closed-loop chemistry experimentation and assist in designing new functional nanomaterials and optimizing their known parameters with AI and machine learning approaches. Due to the possibility of involving in the nanomaterials design process and some hazardous components, routine experimentation under chemists' continuous monitoring is usually required. Shifting to new intelligent technologies in self-driving laboratories with automated closed-loop experimentation requires excluding risks and accidents because of improper AI applications. This paper discusses safe deep reinforcement learning and its application in a simulated environment in self-driving laboratories experimenting with new functional materials.

ID-1924,inproceedings,How Explainability Contributes to Trust in AI,"We provide a philosophical explanation of the relation between artificial intelligence (AI) explainability and trust in AI, providing a case for expressions, such as “explainability fosters trust in AI,” that commonly appear in the literature. This explanation relates the justification of the trustworthiness of an AI with the need to monitor it during its use. We discuss the latter by referencing an account of trust, called “trust as anti-monitoring,” that different authors contributed developing. We focus our analysis on the case of medical AI systems, noting that our proposal is compatible with internalist and externalist justifications of trustworthiness of medical AI and recent accounts of warranted contractual trust. We propose that “explainability fosters trust in AI” if and only if it fosters justified and warranted paradigmatic trust in AI, i.e., trust in the presence of the justified belief that the AI is trustworthy, which, in turn, causally contributes to rely on the AI in the absence of monitoring. We argue that our proposed approach can intercept the complexity of the interactions between physicians and medical AI systems in clinical practice, as it can distinguish between cases where humans hold different beliefs on the trustworthiness of the medical AI and exercise varying degrees of monitoring on them. Finally, we apply our account to user’s trust in AI, where, we argue, explainability does not contribute to trust. By contrast, when considering public trust in AI as used by a human, we argue, it is possible for explainability to contribute to trust. Our account can explain the apparent paradox that in order to trust AI, we must trust AI users not to trust AI completely. Summing up, we can explain how explainability contributes to justified trust in AI, without leaving a reliabilist framework, but only by redefining the trusted entity as an AI-user dyad.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3531146.3533202,3,,,,,,,Andrea Ferrario and Michele Loi,10.1145/3531146.3533202,,,,"artificial intelligence,ethics of artificial intelligence,explainable artificial intelligence,healthcare,trust,trustworthiness",,,1457-1466,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3531146.3533202,2022,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1927,inproceedings,Extracting structured information from the textual description of geometry word problems,"AI (Artificial Intelligence) is playing its role in every field as automation is the way forward. Solving geometry mathematics word problems (MWPs) automatically can help in smart tutoring and has a plethora of applications in many fields. To solve a geometry MWPs, multi-modal methods are needed to parse the question text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and diagram using Image Processing (IP) techniques and combine the information from both. The information is then to be structured and appropriate axioms and theorems need to be applied to transform the question into intermediate equations which could be solved by equation solvers. In this entire pipeline, text parsing of the question content is a crucial component which is precisely the main focus of this paper. There have been attempts in the literature and techniques to solve geometry MWPs have been proposed, however they rely on input predicates and do not generate them automatically. In cases where they are generated, regular expressions are used which lack generalisation and scalability. This paper models the text parsing problem as a Relation Extraction and Natural Language Generation problem where from the question text structured information is generated in the form of predicates. We basically generate appropriate geometric tags by using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) annotator and then utilize these tags to generate predicates that represent the question in a machine readable formal language. To test the proposed approach, a custom dataset is created containing about 500 questions from standard elementary school-level Indian text books. It has been demonstrated through experiments on the custom dataset that the suggested method is capable of extracting geometric relations. To evaluate the generated predicates, we create ground truth predicates for each of the questions through skilled domain experts. We also design a unique method to evaluate the generated predicates with the METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering) metric.

Furthermore, we experiment the proposed technique on another dataset. When tested on Geometry3K data set, a precision of 0.67, recall of 0.64, harmonic mean (Fmean) of 0.64, penalty (p) of 0.27 and final METEOR Score (M) of 0.42 is obtained.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3639233.3639255,3,,,,,,,Archana Narayandas Boob and Prajakta Dnyaneshwar Bodakhe and Mansi Anup Radke and Umesh Ashok Deshpande,10.1145/3639233.3639255,,,,"Artificial Intelligence,Mathematics (Geometry) word problems,Named Entity Recognition,Natural Language Processing,Predicate Generation",,,31-37,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3639233.3639255,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1928,inproceedings,Automated approach for system-level testing of unmanned aerial systems,"Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have a large number of applications in civil and military domains. UAS rely on various avionics systems that are safety-critical and mission-critical. A major requirement of international safety standards is to perform rigorous system-level testing of avionics systems, including software systems. The current industrial practice is to manually create test scenarios, manually or automatically execute these scenarios using simulators, and manual evaluation of the outcomes. A fundamental part of system-level testing of such systems is the simulation of environmental context. The test scenarios typically consist of setting certain environment conditions and testing the system under test in these settings. The state-of-the-art approaches available for this purpose also require manual test scenario development and manual test evaluation. In this research work, we propose an approach to automate the system-level testing of the UAS. The proposed approach (AITester) utilizes model-based testing and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automatically generate, execute, and evaluate various test scenarios. The test scenarios are generated on the fly, i.e., during test execution based on the environmental context at runtime. We develop a toolset to support automation. We perform a pilot experiment using a widely-used open-source autopilot, ArduPilot. The preliminary results show that the AITester is effective and efficient in violating autopilot expected behavior.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678902,3,,,,,,,Hassan Sartaj,10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678902,,,,"artificial intelligence,autopilot,model-based testing,reinforcement learning,unmanned aerial systems",,,1069-1073,,IEEE Press,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678902,2022,,
ID-1929,article,Developing Conversational Agents for Use in Criminal Investigations,"The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in environments that involve high risk and high consequence decision-making is severely hampered by critical design issues. These issues include system transparency and brittleness, where transparency relates to (i) the explainability of results and (ii) the ability of a user to inspect and verify system goals and constraints; and brittleness, (iii) the ability of a system to adapt to new user demands. Transparency is a particular concern for criminal intelligence analysis, where there are significant ethical and trust issues that arise when algorithmic and system processes are not adequately understood by a user. This prevents adoption of potentially useful technologies in policing environments. In this article, we present a novel approach to designing a conversational agent (CA) AI system for intelligence analysis that tackles these issues. We discuss the results and implications of three different studies; a Cognitive Task Analysis to understand analyst thinking when retrieving information in an investigation, Emergent Themes Analysis to understand the explanation needs of different system components, and an interactive experiment with a prototype conversational agent. Our prototype conversational agent, named Pan, demonstrates transparency provision and mitigates brittleness by evolving new CA intentions. We encode interactions with the CA with human factors principles for situation recognition and use interactive visual analytics to support analyst reasoning. Our approach enables complex AI systems, such as Pan, to be used in sensitive environments, and our research has broader application than the use case discussed.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3444369,3,,,,,,,Sam Hepenstal and Leishi Zhang and Neesha Kodagoda and B l. william Wong,10.1145/3444369,2160-6455,3–4,ACM Trans.

ID-1930,inproceedings,You Can't Sit With Us: Exclusionary Pedagogy in AI Ethics Education,"Given a growing concern about the lack of ethical consideration in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, many have begun to question how dominant approaches to the disciplinary education of computer science (CS)—and its implications for AI—has led to the current ""ethics crisis"". However, we claim that the current AI ethics education space relies on a form of ""exclusionary pedagogy,"" where ethics is distilled for computational approaches, but there is no deeper epistemological engagement with other ways of knowing that would benefit ethical thinking or an acknowledgement of the limitations of uni-vocal computational thinking. This results in indifference, devaluation, and a lack of mutual support between CS and humanistic social science (HSS), elevating the myth of technologists as ""ethical unicorns"" that can do it all, though their disciplinary tools are ultimately limited. Through an analysis of computer science education literature and a review of college-level course syllabi in AI ethics, we discuss the limitations of the epistemological assumptions and hierarchies of knowledge which dictate current attempts at including ethics education in CS training and explore evidence for the practical mechanisms through which this exclusion occurs. We then propose a shift towards a substantively collaborative, holistic, and ethically generative pedagogy in AI education.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3442188.3445914,3,,,,,,,Inioluwa Deborah Raji and Morgan Klaus Scheuerman and Razvan Amironesei,10.1145/3442188.3445914,,,,,,,515-525,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3442188.3445914,2021,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1932,inproceedings,Making AI Explainable in the Global South: A Systematic Review,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are quickly becoming pervasive in ways that impact the lives of all humans across the globe. In an effort to make otherwise ”black box” AI/ML systems more understandable, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has arisen with the goal of developing algorithms, toolkits, frameworks, and other techniques that enable people to comprehend, trust, and manage AI systems. However, although XAI is a rapidly growing area of research, most of the work has focused on contexts in the Global North, and little is known about if or how XAI techniques have been designed, deployed, or tested with communities in the Global South. This gap is concerning, especially in light of rapidly growing enthusiasm from governments, companies, and academics to use AI/ML to “solve” problems in the Global South. Our paper contributes the first systematic review of XAI research in the Global South, providing an early look at emerging work in the space. We identified 16 papers from 15 different venues that targeted a wide range of application domains. All of the papers were published in the last three years. Of the 16 papers, 13 focused on applying a technical XAI method, all of which involved the use of (at least some) data that was local to the context. However, only three papers engaged with or involved humans in the work, and only one attempted to deploy their XAI system with target users. We close by reflecting on the current state of XAI research in the Global South, discussing data and model considerations for building and deploying XAI systems in these regions, and highlighting the need for human-centered approaches to XAI in the Global South.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3530190.3534802,3,,,,,,,Chinasa T Okolo and Nicola Dell and Aditya Vashistha,10.1145/3530190.3534802,,,,"Algorithmic Fairness,Artificial Intelligence,Explainability,Global South,HCI4D,ICTD,Machine Learning,XAI4D",,,439-452,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3530190.3534802,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1933,article,Demonstration of generating explanations for black-box algorithms using Lewis,"Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to reduce the opacity of AI-based decision-making systems, allowing humans to scrutinize and trust them. Unlike prior work that attributes the responsibility for an algorithm's decisions to its inputs as a purely associational concept, we propose a principled causality-based approach for explaining black-box decision-making systems. We present the demonstration of Lewis, a system that generates explanations for black-box algorithms at the global, contextual, and local levels, and provides actionable recourse for individuals negatively affected by an algorithm's decision. Lewis makes no assumptions about the internals of the algorithm except for the availability of its input-output data. The explanations generated by Lewis are based on probabilistic contrastive counterfactuals, a concept that can be traced back to philosophical, cognitive, and social foundations of theories on how humans generate and select explanations. We describe the system layout of Lewis wherein an end-user specifies the underlying causal model and Lewis generates explanations for particular use-cases, compares them with explanations generated by state-of-the-art approaches in XAI, and provides actionable recourse when applicable.

The disruptive potential of AI is based on enhanced data processing capabilities which enable broader task automation but also allows AI to change its behavior based on user input. Simultaneously with AI development new platform-based business structures have gained traction and disrupted traditional pipeline business models. Platform business models rely on digital infrastructures to connect the supply and demand. AI has great potential to enable efficient resource allocation in these kinds of systems and in that way enhance the potential of value creation.

ID-1935,inproceedings,Keynote: Privacy and Trust: Friend or Foe,"Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data have fueled the development of fully distributed computational architectures for future cyber systems from data analytics, machine learning (ML) to artificial intelligence (AI). Trust and Privacy become two vital and necessary measures for distributed management of IoT powered big data learning systems and services. However, these two measures have been studied independently in computer science, social science and law.Trust is widely considered as a critical measure for the correctness, predictability, and resiliency (with respect to reliability and security) of software systems, be it big data systems, IoT systems, machine learning systems, or Artificial Intelligence systems. Privacy on the other hand is commonly recognized as a personalization measure for imposing control on the ways of how data is captured, accessed and analyzed, and the ways of how data analytic results from ML models and AI systems should be released and shared.Broadly speaking, in human society, we rely on three types of trust in our everyday work and life to achieve a peaceful mind: (1) verifiable belief-driven trust, (2) statistical evidence based trust, and (3) complex systemwide cognitive trust. Interestingly, privacy has been a more controversial subject. On one hand, privacy is an important built-in dimension of trust, which is deep rooted in human society, and a highly valued virtue in Western civilization. Even though different human beings may have diverse levels of privacy sensitivity, we all trust that our privacy is respected in our social and professional environments, including at home, at work and in social commons. Thus, Privacy is a perfect example of three-fold trust: belief-driven, statistical evident, and complex cognitive trust. On the other hand, many view privacy (and privacy protection) as an antagonistic measure of trust and one is often asked to show trust at the cost of giving up on privacy.Are Privacy and Trust friend or foe? This keynote will share my view to this question from multiple perspectives. I conjecture that the answer to this question can fundamentally change the ways we conduct research in privacy and trust in the next generation of big data enhanced cyber learning systems from data mining, machine learning to artificial intelligence.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3139531.3139537,3,,,,,,,Ling Liu,10.1145/3139531.3139537,,,,"big data,deep learning,internet of things,privacy,trust",,,11,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3139531.3139537,2017,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1936,inproceedings,AI-driven web API testing,"Testing of web APIs is nowadays more critical than ever before, as they are the current standard for software integration. A bug in an organization's web API could have a huge impact both internally (services relying on that API) and externally (third-party applications and end users). Most existing tools and testing approaches require writing tests or instrumenting the system under test (SUT). The main aim of this dissertation is to take web API testing to an unprecedented level of automation and thoroughness. To this end, we plan to apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for the autonomous detection of software failures. Specifically, the idea is to develop intelligent programs (we call them ""bots"") capable of generating hundreds, thousands or even millions of test inputs and to evaluate whether the test outputs are correct based on: 1) patterns learned from previous executions of the SUT; and 2) knowledge gained from analyzing thousands of similar programs.

ID-1938,inproceedings,Disparate Impact of Artificial Intelligence Bias in Ridehailing Economy's Price Discrimination Algorithms,"Ridehailing applications that collect mobility data from individuals to inform smart city planning predict each trip's fare pricing with automated algorithms that rely on artificial intelligence (AI). This type of AI algorithm, namely a price discrimination algorithm, is widely used in the industry's black box systems for dynamic individualized pricing. Lacking transparency, studying such AI systems for fairness and disparate impact has not been possible without access to data used in generating the outcomes of price discrimination algorithms. Recently, in an effort to enhance transparency in city planning, the city of Chicago regulation mandated that transportation providers publish anonymized data on ridehailing. As a result, we present the first large-scale measurement of the disparate impact of price discrimination algorithms used by ridehailing applications.The application of random effects models from the meta-analysis literature combines the city-level effects of AI bias on fare pricing from census tract attributes, aggregated from the American Community Survey. An analysis of 100 million ridehailing samples from the city of Chicago indicates a significant disparate impact in fare pricing of neighborhoods due to AI bias learned from ridehailing utilization patterns associated with demographic attributes. Neighborhoods with larger non-white populations, higher poverty levels, younger residents, and high education levels are significantly associated with higher fare prices, with combined effect sizes, measured in Cohen's d, of -0.32, -0.28, 0.69, and 0.24 for each demographic, respectively.

ID-1939,article,Duty to Respond: The Challenges Social Service Providers Face When Charged with Keeping Youth Safe Online,"Social service providers play a vital role in the developmental outcomes of underprivileged youth as they transition into adulthood. Educators, mental health professionals, juvenile justice officers, and child welfare caseworkers often have first-hand knowledge of the trials uniquely faced by these vulnerable youth and are charged with mitigating harmful risks, such as mental health challenges, child abuse, drug use, and sex trafficking. Yet, less is known about whether or how social service providers assess and mitigate theonline risk experiences of youth under their care. Therefore, as part of the National Science Foundation (NSF) I-Corps program, we conducted interviews with 37 social service providers (SSPs) who work with underprivileged youth to determine what (if any) online risks are most concerning to them given their role in youth protection, how they assess or become aware of these online risk experiences, and whether they see value in the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential solution for online risk detection. Overall, online sexual risks (e.g., sexual grooming and abuse) and cyberbullying were the most salient concern across all social service domains, especially when these experiences crossed the boundary between the digital and the physical worlds. Yet, SSPs had to rely heavily on youth self-reports to know whether and when online risks occurred, which required building a trusting relationship with youth; otherwise, SSPs became aware only after a formal investigation had been launched. Therefore, most SSPs found value in the potential for using AI as an early detection system and to monitor youth, but they were concerned that such a solution would not be feasible due to a lack of resources to adequately respond to online incidences, access to the necessary digital trace data (e.g., social media), context, and concerns about violating the trust relationships they built with youth. Thus, such automated risk detection systems should be designed and deployed with caution, as their implementation could cause youth to mistrust adults, thereby limiting the receipt of necessary guidance and support.

ID-1940,inproceedings,Alternating Blind Identification of Power Sources for Mobile SoCs,"The need for faster Systems on Chip (SoCs) has accelerated scaling trends, leading to a considerable power density increase and raising critical power and thermal challenges. The ability to measure power consumption of different hardware units is essential for the operation and improvement of mobile SoCs, as well as the enhancement of the power efficiency of the software that runs on them. SoCs are usually enabled with embedded thermal sensors to measure the temperature at the hardware unit level; however, they lack the ability to sense the power. In this paper we introduce an Alternating Blind Identification of Power sources (Alternating-BPI), a technique that accurately estimates the power consumption of individual SoC units without the use of any design based models. The proposed technique uses a novel approach to blindly identify the sources of power consumption, by relying only on the measurements from the embedded thermal sensors and the total power consumption. The accuracy and applicability of the proposed technique was verified using simulation and experimental data. Alternating-BPI is able to estimate the power at the SoC hardware unit level with up to 98.1% accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed technique on a commercial SoC and provide a fine-grain analysis of the power profiles of CPU and GPU Apps, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Apps. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed technique could be used to estimate the power consumption per-process by relying on the estimated per-unit power numbers and per-unit hardware utilization numbers.

ID-1942,article,StarFL: Hybrid Federated Learning Architecture for Smart Urban Computing,"From facial recognition to autonomous driving, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will transform the way we live and work over the next couple of decades. Existing AI approaches for urban computing suffer from various challenges, including dealing with synchronization and processing of vast amount of data generated from the edge devices, as well as the privacy and security of individual users, including their bio-metrics, locations, and itineraries. Traditional centralized-based approaches require data in each organization be uploaded to the central database, which may be prohibited by data protection acts, such as GDPR and CCPA. To decouple model training from the need to store the data in the cloud, a new training paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) is proposed. FL enables multiple devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping the training data on devices locally, which can significantly mitigate privacy leakage risk. However, under urban computing scenarios, data are often communication-heavy, high-frequent, and asynchronized, posing new challenges to FL implementation. To handle these challenges, we propose a new hybrid federated learning architecture called StarFL. By combining with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and (Beidou) satellites, StarFL enables safe key distribution, encryption, and decryption, and provides a verification mechanism for each participant to ensure the security of the local data. In addition, StarFL can provide accurate timestamp matching to facilitate synchronization of multiple clients.

ID-1944,inproceedings,Fighting organized crime by automatically detecting money laundering-related financial transactions,"Money laundering is the set of operations aimed at giving a legitimate appearance to capital whose origin is illegal, thus making it more difficult to identify and subsequently recover it. It is one of the phenomena on which the so-called underground economy relies and therefore constitutes a crime for which the charge for money laundering applies. For supporting the fight against this phenomenon, the interest towards analysis models for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) based on a combined use of automatic tools and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques increases, as it is also shown by the European Central Bank (ECB) during recent press conferences. Following this direction, this paper proposes a model for enhancing the detection of suspicious transactions related to money laundering. It is based on a set of features that are defined by considering different aspects such as the time, the amount of money, number of transactions, type of operations and level of internationalization. An AI-based computational approach centered on Machine Learning (ML) techniques has been adopted to evaluate the goodness of such feature-based model, in supporting the automatic detection of suspicious transactions, by experimenting 5 different classifiers. From the experiments emerged that the Random Forest provided the best performance not only among the classifiers tested within the paper, but also in comparison to those presented in the related work with an accuracy, a recall and f1-score greater than 94% by decreasing the False Positive Rate (FPR). Furthermore, an analysis on the feature importance has been provided, to understand which feature, among the proposed ones, plays the major role in such application domain.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3465481.3469196,3,,,,,,,Andrea Tundis and Soujanya Nemalikanti and Max Mühlhäuser,10.1145/3465481.3469196,,,,"Money laundering detection,classification,financial transaction analysis,machine learning",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3465481.3469196,2021,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1945,inproceedings,In a Silent Way: Communication Between AI and Improvising Musicians Beyond Sound,"Collaboration is built on trust, and establishing trust with a creative Artificial Intelligence is difficult when the decision process or internal state driving its behaviour isn't exposed. When human musicians improvise together, a number of extra-musical cues are used to augment musical communication and expose mental or emotional states which affect musical decisions and the effectiveness of the collaboration. We developed a collaborative improvising AI drummer that communicates its confidence through an emoticon-based visualisation. The AI was trained on musical performance data, as well as real-time skin conductance, of musicians improvising with professional drummers, exposing both musical and extra-musical cues to inform its generative process. Uni- and bi-directional extra-musical communication with real and false values were tested by experienced improvising musicians. Each condition was evaluated using the FSS-2 questionnaire, as a proxy for musical engagement. The results show a positive correlation between extra-musical communication of machine internal state and human musical engagement.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3290605.3300268,3,,,,,,,Jon McCormack and Toby Gifford and Patrick Hutchings and Maria Teresa Llano Rodriguez and Matthew Yee-King and Mark d'Inverno,10.1145/3290605.3300268,,,,"ai systems,extra-musical communication,improvisation",,,1-11,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3290605.3300268,2019,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1946,inproceedings,Explaining Black-Box Algorithms Using Probabilistic Contrastive Counterfactuals,"There has been a recent resurgence of interest in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) that aims to reduce the opaqueness of AI-based decision-making systems, allowing humans to scrutinize and trust them. Prior work in this context has focused on the attribution of responsibility for an algorithm's decisions to its inputs wherein responsibility is typically approached as a purely associational concept. In this paper, we propose a principled causality-based approach for explaining black-box decision-making systems that addresses limitations of existing methods in XAI. At the core of our framework lies probabilistic contrastive counterfactuals, a concept that can be traced back to philosophical, cognitive, and social foundations of theories on how humans generate and select explanations. We show how such counterfactuals can quantify the direct and indirect influences of a variable on decisions made by an algorithm, and provide actionable recourse for individuals negatively affected by the algorithm's decision. Unlike prior work, our system, LEWIS: (1)~can compute provably effective explanations and recourse at local, global and contextual levels; (2)~is designed to work with users with varying levels of background knowledge of the underlying causal model; and (3)~makes no assumptions about the internals of an algorithmic system except for the availability of its input-output data. We empirically evaluate LEWIS on four real-world datasets and show that it generates human-understandable explanations that improve upon state-of-the-art approaches in XAI, including the popular LIME and SHAP. Experiments on synthetic data further demonstrate the correctness of LEWIS's explanations and the scalability of its recourse algorithm.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3448016.3458455,3,,,,,,,Sainyam Galhotra and Romila Pradhan and Babak Salimi,10.1145/3448016.3458455,,,,"causality,explainable AI,machine learning,recourse",,,577-590,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3448016.3458455,2021,"New York, NY, USA",

In much of the literature, AI systems have been limited to playing one game. Although, this specialization has resulted in stronger AI gaming systems it does not address the key concerns of AI research, which focuses on the development of AI agents that can autonomously interpret, learn, and apply new knowledge. To achieve human level performance, current AI systems rely on game specific knowledge of an expert. This paper proposes a RTS language in hopes of shifting the current research focus to the development of general RTS agents. General RTS agents are AI gaming systems that can play any RTS game, defined in the proposed RTS language. The structure of the RTS language prevents game specific knowledge from being hard coded into the system, thereby facilitating research that addresses the fundamental concerns of artificial intelligence.",,3,,,,,,,Roy Hayes and Peter Beling and William Scherer,,,,,,,,3495-3504,,IEEE Press,,,2014,,
ID-1948,article,Meta-Learning to Improve Unsupervised Intrusion Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems,"Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based classifiers rely on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to provide functionalities that system architects are often willing to integrate into critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). However, such algorithms may misclassify observations, with potential detrimental effects on the system itself or on the health of people and of the environment. In addition, CPSs may be subject to threats that were not previously known, motivating the need for building Intrusion Detectors (IDs) that can effectively deal with zero-day attacks. Different studies were directed to compare misclassifications of various algorithms to identify the most suitable one for a given system. Unfortunately, even the most suitable algorithm may still show an unsatisfactory number of misclassifications when system requirements are strict. A possible solution may rely on the adoption of meta-learners, which build ensembles of base-learners to reduce misclassifications and that are widely used for supervised learning. Meta-learners have the potential to reduce misclassifications with respect to non-meta learners: however, misleading base-learners may let the meta-learner leaning towards misclassifications and therefore their behavior needs to be carefully assessed through empirical evaluation. To such extent, in this paper we investigate, expand, empirically evaluate, and discuss meta-learning approaches that rely on ensembles of unsupervised algorithms to detect (zero-day) intrusions in CPSs. Our experimental comparison is conducted by means of public datasets belonging to network intrusion detection and biometric authentication systems, which are common IDSs for CPSs. Overall, we selected 21 datasets, 15 unsupervised algorithms and 9 different meta-learning approaches. Results allow discussing the applicability and suitability of meta-learning for unsupervised anomaly detection, comparing metric scores achieved by base algorithms and meta-learners. Analyses and discussion end up showing how the adoption of meta-learners significantly reduces misclassifications when detecting (zero-day) intrusions in CPSs.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3467470,3,,,,,,,Tommaso Zoppi and Mohamad Gharib and Muhammad Atif and Andrea Bondavalli,10.1145/3467470,2378-962X,4,ACM Trans.

ID-1949,inproceedings,The Data Firehose and AI in Government: Why Data Management is a Key to Value and Ethics,"Technical and organizational innovations such as Open Data, Internet of Things and Big Data have fueled renewed interest in policy analytics in the public sector. This revamped version of policy analysis continues the long-standing tradition of applying statistical modeling to better understand policy effects and decision making, but also incorporates other computational approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) and computer simulation. Although much attention has been given to the development of capabilities for data analysis, there is much less attention to understanding the role of data management in a context of AI in government. In this paper, we argue that data management capabilities are foundational to data analysis of any kind, but even more important in the present AI context. This is so because without proper data management, simply acquiring data or systems will not produce desired outcomes. We also argue that realizing the potential of AI for social good relies on investments specifically focused on this social outcome, investments in the processes of building trust in government data, and ensuring the data are ready and suitable for use, for both immediate and future uses.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3325112.3325245,3,,,,,,,Teresa Harrison and Luis F.

Much of the focus in the technology development has been on human-machine interactions, leading to a host of related technology-centric questions. In this paper, we focus instead on the impact of these technologies on human-human interactions and relationships within the healthcare domain. In particular, we argue that trust plays a central role for relationships in the healthcare domain, and the introduction of healthcare AI can potentially have significant impacts on those relations of trust. We contend that healthcare AI systems ought to be treated as assistive technologies that go beyond the usual functions of medical devices. As a result, we need to rethink regulation of healthcare AI systems to ensure they advance relevant values. We propose three distinct guidelines that can be universalized across federal regulatory boards to ensure that patient-doctor trust is not detrimentally affected by the deployment and widespread adoption of healthcare AI technologies.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3278721.3278771,3,,,,,,,Emily LaRosa and David Danks,10.1145/3278721.3278771,,,,"ethics,healthcare ai,regulatory framework,trust",,,210-215,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3278721.3278771,2018,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1951,inproceedings,Teaching modelling literacy: an artificial intelligence approach,"In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), models are used to build and analyze complex systems. In the last decades, different modelling formalisms have been proposed for supporting software development. However, their adoption and practice strongly rely on mastering essential modelling skills to develop a complete and coherent model-based system. Moreover, it is often difficult for novice modellers to get direct and timely feedback and recommendations on their modelling strategies and decisions, particularly in large classroom settings which hinders their learning. Certainly, there is an opportunity to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to an MDE learning environment to empower the provisioning of automated and intelligent modelling advocacy. In this paper, we propose a framework called ModBud (a modelling buddy) to educate novice modellers about the art of abstraction. ModBud uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create modelling bots with the aim of improving the modelling skills of novice modellers and assisting other practitioners, too. These bots could be used to support teaching with automatic creation or grading of models and enhance learning beyond the traditional classroom-based MDE education with timely feedback and personalized tutoring.

ID-1952,inproceedings,AI Meets AI: Leveraging Query Executions to Improve Index Recommendations,"State-of-the-art index tuners rely on query optimizer's cost estimates to search for the index configuration with the largest estimated execution cost improvement`. Due to well-known limitations in optimizer's estimates, in a significant fraction of cases, an index estimated to improve a query's execution cost, e.g., CPU time, makes that worse when implemented. Such errors are a major impediment for automated indexing in production systems. We observe that comparing the execution cost of two plans of the same query corresponding to different index configurations is a key step during index tuning. Instead of using optimizer's estimates for such comparison, our key insight is that formulating it as a classification task in machine learning results in significantly higher accuracy. We present a study of the design space for this classification problem. We further show how to integrate this classifier into the state-of-the-art index tuners with minimal modifications, i.e., how artificial intelligence (AI) can benefit automated indexing (AI). Our evaluation using industry-standard benchmarks and a large number of real customer workloads demonstrates up to 5x reduction in the errors in identifying the cheaper plan in a pair, which eliminates almost all query execution cost regressions when the model is used in index tuning.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3299869.3324957,3,,,,,,,Bailu Ding and Sudipto Das and Ryan Marcus and Wentao Wu and Surajit Chaudhuri and Vivek R Narasayya,10.1145/3299869.3324957,,,,"automated indexing,autonomous database management,performance tuning,relational database-as-a-service",,,1241-1258,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3299869.3324957,2019,"New York, NY, USA",

Trust can be a key element as it can help overcome the fear of loss and can supports users interactions. Therefore making it important to design methods and tools to foster trust between users and these technologies, especially capable of assessing users trust objectively and serving as an interface applicable in real-time during the interaction. Measuring the psycho-physiological signals of the user provides a way for objective assessment of users trust towards the technology, with the potential for real-time trust assessment, provided that we know the neural correlates of trust. This study aims to show that it is indeed possible to objectively detect users trust level in AI technologies, and provides details on what physiological signals are most suitable for real-time trust detection, as well as details on the predictive machine learning model used.

However, many researches reflect users' doubts about the feedback results of AI system. Therefore, this paper focuses on the design of the user-friendly intelligent self diagnosis system, using interdisciplinary research methods. Firstly, based on the psychological questionnaire and interview, this paper studies the public's cognition of the intelligent self diagnosis system, and discusses how to effectively improve the user's recognition and trust of the intelligent self diagnosis system. It is found that the credibility of the intelligent self diagnosis system can be improved by further improving the transparency of the system. For example, users can be provided with four different types of information, including system reasoning, system reliability, information source and personalized information. On the basis of interviews, 48 volunteers were invited to carry out a comparative experiment in groups to evaluate the impact of medical interpretation of intelligent self diagnosis system on patients' perception and trust under different transparency and accuracy models. We found that the improvement of system reliability information (i.e. accuracy model and confidence score) composed of accuracy model and confidence score strengthens patients' cognition of AI system and improves the user trust of the system; while the detailed display of system reasoning and logic can improve the comprehensibility of medical advice output of the system, but does not substantially improve the user trust.

ID-1957,article,ReDCrypt: Real-Time Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning Inference in Clouds Using FPGAs,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly incorporated into the cloud business in order to improve the functionality (e.g., accuracy) of the service. The adoption of AI as a cloud service raises serious privacy concerns in applications where the risk of data leakage is not acceptable. Examples of such applications include scenarios where clients hold potentially sensitive private information such as medical records, financial data, and/or location. This article proposes ReDCrypt, the first reconfigurable hardware-accelerated framework that empowers privacy-preserving inference of deep learning models in cloud servers. ReDCrypt is well-suited for streaming (a.k.a., real-time AI) settings where clients need to dynamically analyze their data as it is collected over time without having to queue the samples to meet a certain batch size. Unlike prior work, ReDCrypt neither requires to change how AI models are trained nor relies on two non-colluding servers to perform. The privacy-preserving computation in ReDCrypt is executed using Yao’s Garbled Circuit (GC) protocol. We break down the deep learning inference task into two phases: (i) privacy-insensitive (local) computation, and (ii) privacy-sensitive (interactive) computation. We devise a high-throughput and power-efficient implementation of GC protocol on FPGA for the privacy-sensitive phase. ReDCrypt’s accompanying API provides support for seamless integration of ReDCrypt into any deep learning framework. Proof-of-concept evaluations for different DL applications demonstrate up to 57-fold higher throughput per core compared to the best prior solution with no drop in the accuracy.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3242899,3,,,,,,,Bita Darvish Rouhani and Siam Umar Hussain and Kristin Lauter and Farinaz Koushanfar,10.1145/3242899,1936-7406,3,ACM Trans.

ID-1958,inproceedings,Explainable AI in Industry: Practical Challenges and Lessons Learned,"Artificial Intelligence is increasingly playing an integral role in determining our day-to-day experiences. Moreover, with the proliferation of AI based solutions in areas such as hiring, lending, criminal justice, healthcare, and education, the resulting personal and professional implications of AI have become far-reaching. The dominant role played by AI models in these domains has led to a growing concern regarding potential bias in these models, and a demand for model transparency and interpretability [11]. Model explainability is considered a prerequisite for building trust and adoption of AI systems in high stakes domains such as lending and healthcare&nbsp;[1] which require reliability, safety, and fairness. It is also critical to automated transportation, and other industrial applications with significant socio-economic implications such as predictive maintenance, exploration of natural resources, and climate change modeling. As a consequence, AI researchers and practitioners have focused their attention on explainable AI to help them better trust and understand models at scale [14, 15, 25]. The challenges for the research community include: (i) defining model explainability, (ii) formulating explainability tasks for understanding model behavior and developing solutions for these tasks, and finally (iii) designing measures for evaluating the performance of models in explainability tasks. In this tutorial, we will first motivate the need for model interpretability and explainability in AI [6] from societal, legal, enterprise, end-user, and model developer perspectives, and present techniques &amp; tools for providing explainability as part of AI/ML systems [13].

ID-1959,article,Refining network intents for self-driving networks,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity for the adoption of self-driving networks. However, network operators or home-network users still do not have the right tools to exploit these new advancements in AI, since they have to rely on low-level languages to specify network policies. Intent-based networking (IBN) allows operators to specify high-level policies that dictate how the network should behave without worrying how they are translated into configuration commands in the network devices. However, the existing research proposals for IBN fail to exploit the knowledge and feedback from the network operator to validate or improve the translation of intents. In this paper, we introduce a novel intent-refinement process that uses machine learning and feedback from the operator to translate the operator's utterances into network configurations. Our refinement process uses a sequence-to-sequence learning model to extract intents from natural language and the feedback from the operator to improve learning. The key insight of our process is an intermediate representation that resembles natural language that is suitable to collect feedback from the operator but is structured enough to facilitate precise translations. Our prototype interacts with a network operator using natural language and translates the operator input to the intermediate representation before translating to SDN rules. Our experimental results show that our process achieves a correlation coefficient squared (i.e., R-squared) of 0.99 for a dataset with 5000 entries and the operator feedback significantly improves the accuracy of our model.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3310165.3310173,3,,,,,,,Arthur Selle Jacobs and Ricardo José Pfitscher and Ronaldo Alves Ferreira and Lisandro Zambenedetti Granville,10.1145/3310165.3310173,0146-4833,5,SIGCOMM Comput.

Fortunately, modern FPGA devices, capable of efficient parallel processing and application-specific programmability, readily meet the underlying physical layer requirements of the NVMe protocol, therefore providing unprecedented opportunities to implementing a rich-featured NVMe middleware to benefit modern high-performance embedded computing.In this article, we present how to rethink existing accessing mechanisms of NVMe storage and devise innovative hardware-assisted solutions to accelerating NVMe data access performance for the high-performance embedded computing system. Our key idea is to exploit the massively parallel I/O queuing capability, provided by the NVMe storage system, through leveraging FPGAs’ reconfigurability and native hardware computing power to operate transparently to the main processor. Specifically, our DirectNVM system aims at providing effective hardware constructs for facilitating high-performance and scalable userspace storage applications through (1) hardening all the essential NVMe driver functionalities, therefore avoiding expensive OS syscalls and enabling zero-copy data access from the application, (2) relying on hardware for the I/O communication control instead of relying on OS-level interrupts that can significantly reduce both total I/O latency and its variance, and (3) exposing cutting-edge and application-specific weighted-round-robin I/O traffic scheduling to the userspace.To validate our design methodology, we developed a complete DirectNVM system utilizing the Xilinx Zynq MPSoC architecture that incorporates a high-performance application processor (APU) equipped with DDR4 system memory and a hardened configurable PCIe Gen3 block in its programmable logic part. We then measured the storage bandwidth and I/O latency of both our DirectNVM system and a conventional OS-based system when executing the standard FIO benchmark suite&nbsp;[2]. Specifically, compared against the PetaLinux built-in kernel driver code running on a Zynq MPSoC, our DirectNVM has shown to achieve up to 18.4 higher throughput and up to 4.5 lower latency. To ensure the fairness of our performance comparison, we also measured our DirectNVM system against the Intel SPDK&nbsp;[26], a highly optimized userspace asynchronous NVMe I/O framework running on a X86 PC system. Our experiment results have shown that our DirectNVM, even running on a considerably less powerful embedded ARM processor than a full-scale AMD processor, achieved up to 2.2 higher throughput and 1.3 lower latency. Furthermore, by experimenting with a multi-threading test case, we have demonstrated that our DirectNVM’s weighted-round-robin scheduling can significantly optimize the bandwidth allocation between latency-constraint frontend applications and other backend applications in real-time systems. Finally, we have developed a theoretical framework of performance modeling with classic queuing theory that can quantitatively define the relationship between a system’s I/O performance and its I/O implementation.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3463911,3,,,,,,,Yu Zou and Amro Awad and Mingjie Lin,10.1145/3463911,1539-9087,1,ACM Trans.

ID-1961,inproceedings,Accelerating public service delivery in India: application of internet of things and artificial intelligence in agriculture,"The application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the public sector can usher performance enhancement, productivity and social equity in public service delivery mechanisms. More specifically, emerging digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be employed for more effective retrieval and analysis of complex, real-time data that could also be captured and shared by devices supporting Internet of Things. Literature asserts that governments worldwide must adopt solutions offered by these emerging technologies to drive innovation in public service delivery mechanisms. Appreciating these claims, this study aims to explore the current and potential use of IoT and AI. Based on the related review of literature, the study puts forth a conceptual framework for creating an open and integrated national level agriculture stack (christened as KisanOne by the authors) so that developing countries like India can effectively espouse data driven approach in its agriculture sector. ""Kisan One"" combines varied aspects of a farmers' activities including weather forecast, soil health indices, seed procurement cycle, sowing cycles, details of fertilizers availability, crop prices, etc, in a unified national stack that is accessible to all the stakeholders using application programming interfaces (APIs). Needless to say, the proposed KisanOne is a utopian implementation where existing and contemporary digital initiatives get unified on a single platform.Datasets themselves have little intrinsic value sans any ability to extract meaning from it. Intelligent data analytics could be employed on real time datasets of KisanOne both for evidence based decision making as well as for malicious intent. This paper, therefore, attempts to offer an insight into such challenges as well as suggest policy recommendations that could strengthen existing regulatory mechanisms for effective implementation of IoT and AI in existing public service delivery schemes of India. The paper is divided into four broad sections. The first section builds the Background of the paper. The next section is divided into four subsections and in this section instance of Agriculture has been detailed with reference to its current scenario and prevailing solutions. India has started using technology in Agriculture to a great extent- some of these applications such as Kisan Suvidha2 mobile app, mKisan SMS Portal, Farmer's Portal, Soil Health Card, Fertilizer Monitoring System(FMS) software, Agrimarket App have been delineated in the study. A use case on transformation of agriculture sector using IoT and AI is also presented in one of the sub-sections. A National Level Integrated Agriculture Stack is also proposed in this paper. The subsequent section presents brief picture of key challenges of implementing IoT and AI in Agriculture sector followed by recommendations and Consulive Remarks. It is an innovative and descriptive study that primarily relies on secondary data gleaned from international/national journals, reports of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and other online academic sources coupled with creative out-of-box thinking to propose the application of IoT and AI in varied public sectors with special emphasis on Agriculture.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3428502.3428510,3,,,,,,,Charru Malhotra and Rashmi Anand,10.1145/3428502.3428510,,,,,,,62-69,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3428502.3428510,2020,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1962,inproceedings,SIGIR 2018 Workshop on ExplainAble Recommendation and Search (EARS 2018),"Explainable recommendation and search attempt to develop models or methods that not only generate high-quality recommendation or search results, but also intuitive explanations of the results for users or system designers, which can help to improve the system transparency, persuasiveness, trustworthiness, and effectiveness, etc. This is even more important in personalized search and recommendation scenarios, where users would like to know why a particular product, web page, news report, or friend suggestion exists in his or her own search and recommendation lists. The motivation of the workshop is to promote the research and application of Explainable Recommendation and Search, under the background of Explainable AI in a more general sense. Early recommendation and search systems adopted intuitive yet easily explainable models to generate recommendation and search lists, such as user-based and item-based collaborative filtering for recommendation, which provide recommendations based on similar users or items, or TF-IDF based retrieval models for search, which provide document ranking lists according to word similarity between different documents. However, state-of-the-art recommendation and search models extensively rely on complex machine learning and latent representation models such as matrix factorization or even deep neural networks, and they work with various types of information sources such as ratings, text, images, audio or video signals. The complexity nature of state-of-the-art models make search and recommendation systems as blank-boxes for end users, and the lack of explainability weakens the persuasiveness and trustworthiness of the system for users, making explainable recommendation and search important research issues to the IR community. In a broader sense, researchers in the whole artificial intelligence community have also realized the importance of Explainable AI, which aims to address a wide range of AI explainability problems in deep learning, computer vision, automatic driving systems, and natural language processing tasks. As an important branch of AI research, this further highlights the importance and urgency for our IR/RecSys community to address the explainability issues of various recommendation and search systems.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3209978.3210193,3,,,,,,,Yongfeng Zhang and Yi Zhang and Min Zhang,10.1145/3209978.3210193,,,,"explainable recommendation,explainable search,information retrieval,recommendation systems",,,1411-1413,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3209978.3210193,2018,"New York, NY, USA",

In many cases, these systems must adapt to properly react to numerous scenarios. This adaptivity could be a simple action such as activating an additional server, or could be incredibly complex in creating a completely new adaptation strategy. In the following work, we address the question ""Is Adaptability a Core Property of Intelligent Systems?"" We determine that due to the ambiguity of the term `intelligent system' and the wide range of such systems, that there is no clear and definitive answer to this question.

ID-1965,inproceedings,Towards a legal definition of machine intelligence: the argument for artificial personhood in the age of deep learning,"The paper dissects the intricacies of Automated Decision Making (ADM) and urges for refining the current legal definition of AI when pinpointing the role of algorithms in the advent of ubiquitous computing, data analytics and deep learning. ADM relies upon a plethora of algorithmic approaches and has already found a wide range of applications in marketing automation, social networks, computational neuroscience, robotics, and other fields. Our main aim here is to explain how a thorough understanding of the layers of ADM could be a first good step towards this direction: AI operates on a formula based on several degrees of automation employed in the interaction between the programmer, the user, and the algorithm; this can take various shapes and thus yield different answers to key issues regarding agency. The paper offers a fresh look at the concept of ""Machine Intelligence"", which exposes certain vulnerabilities in its current legal interpretation. Most importantly, it further helps us to explore whether the argument for ""artificial personhood"" holds any water. To highlight this argument, analysis proceeds in two parts: Part 1 strives to provide a taxonomy of the various levels of automation that reflects distinct degrees of Human - Machine interaction and can thus serve as a point of reference for outlining distinct rights and obligations of the programmer and the consumer: driverless cars are used as a case study to explore the several layers of human and machine interaction. These different degrees of automation reflect various levels of complexities in the underlying algorithms, and pose very interesting questions in terms of agency and dynamic tasks carried out by software agents. Part 2 further discusses the intricate nature of the underlying algorithms and artificial neural networks (ANN) that implement them and considers how one can interpret and utilize observed patterns in acquired data. Is ""artificial personhood"" a sufficient legal response to highly sophisticated machine learning techniques employed in decision making that successfully emulate or even enhance human cognitive abilities?",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3086512.3086524,3,,,,,,,Argyro Karanasiou and Dimitris Pinotsis,10.1145/3086512.3086524,,,,"ANN,algorithmic agency,machine learning,personhood hybrids",,,119-128,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3086512.3086524,2017,"New York, NY, USA",

Artificially intelligent (AI) agents could assist these older adults, keeping them in their homes longer. For this to happen, older adults must be willing to adopt and rely on agents. Would they trust an agent that might need to report their decline to others? We conducted a speed dating study exploring the impact of agent affiliation (i.e., who the agent should work for). Our healthy and declining participants reacted positively to the idea of agents supporting them. They particularly recognized how the agent would reduce the burden placed on their family caregivers. They viewed affiliation to be dynamic, shifting from the declining older adult and orienting more to their caregivers over the course of cognitive decline.

Yet, current XAI systems are rarely evaluated by measuring the performance of human+AI teams on actual decision-making tasks. We conducted two online experiments and one in-person think-aloud study to evaluate two currently common techniques for evaluating XAI systems: (1) using proxy, artificial tasks such as how well humans predict the AI's decision from the given explanations, and (2) using subjective measures of trust and preference as predictors of actual performance. The results of our experiments demonstrate that evaluations with proxy tasks did not predict the results of the evaluations with the actual decision-making tasks. Further, the subjective measures on evaluations with actual decision-making tasks did not predict the objective performance on those same tasks. Our results suggest that by employing misleading evaluation methods, our field may be inadvertently slowing its progress toward developing human+AI teams that can reliably perform better than humans or AIs alone.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3377325.3377498,3,,,,,,,Zana Buçinca and Phoebe Lin and Krzysztof Z Gajos and Elena L Glassman,10.1145/3377325.3377498,,,,"artificial intelligence,explanations,trust",,,454-464,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3377325.3377498,2020,"New York, NY, USA",

The recent manufacturing chip shortage illuminates digital technologies’ physicality and the fragility of the commodity and production networks that underpin the AI systems our cities, governments, and workplaces have come to rely on. Those that are conventionally considered to ‘make’ AI through the design of AI systems are largely divorced from AI's materiality and the craft of making AI. Corresponding research on AI and creativity focuses primarily on the digital artefacts, potentials and imaginaries AI creates, and less so on the social and material artefacts embedded in its ability to create. We hope to push participants beyond the theoretical knowing of AI materiality to tactile knowing through a practice-based approach to ‘making’ AI. Reorienting the focus of AI to materials and the supply chain as sites of creative intervention could leverage the potential of sensory, tactile experiences to spur reimaginations of AI technologies and infrastructures.

We have developed two AI interviewers with distinct personalities and deployed them in a series of real-world events. We present findings from four such deployments involving 1,280 users, including 606 actual job applicants. Notably, users are more willing to confide in and listen to an AI interviewer with a serious, assertive personality in a high-stakes job interview.

However, the user perspective has received less attention in XAI research, leading to a (1) lack of involvement of users in the design process of local model-agnostic explanations representations and (2) a limited understanding of how users visually attend them. Against this backdrop, we refined representations of local explanations from four well-established model-agnostic XAI methods in an iterative design process with users. Moreover, we evaluated the refined explanation representations in a laboratory experiment using eye-tracking technology as well as self-reports and interviews. Our results show that users do not necessarily prefer simple explanations and that their individual characteristics, such as gender and previous experience with AI systems, strongly influence their preferences. In addition, users find that some explanations are only useful in certain scenarios making the selection of an appropriate explanation highly dependent on context.

However, research indicates that most work on implementing ethical requirements in SE management primarily focuses on technical development, with scarce findings for middle and higher-level management. We investigate this by interviewing ten Finnish SE executives in middle and higher-level management to examine how they consider and implement ethical requirements. We use ethical requirements from the European Union (EU) Trustworthy Ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI as our reference for ethical requirements and an Agile portfolio management framework to analyze implementation. Our findings reveal a general consideration of privacy and data governance ethical requirements as legal requirements with no other consideration for ethical requirements identified.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly in recent years and adopted in various industries. From literature review, AI is being increasingly used in the resource recycling industry to optimize processes, improve efficiency, and enhance sustainability. This study used machine learning, an AI technology, to conduct model training and identify optimal model validation in Taiwan's resource recycling industry. A case example was implemented to reduce the cost by AI's recommendation of more accurate borax blending ratios. By accepting AI's recommendation of accurate borax blending ratios, it can reduce the non-compliance rate by 45% and at the same time reduce the raw material usage by approximately 2∼3%, saving approximately N.T.D. 1-2 million per year.

Preliminary work has proposed the term paradata to describe the unique documentation needs that emerge for archivists using AI tools to process records in their collections. For the purposes of archivists working with AI, paradata is conceptualized here as information recorded and preserved about records’ processing with AI tools; it is a category of data that is defined both by its relationship with other datasets and by the documentary purpose it serves. This article surveys relevant literature across three contexts to scope the relevant scholarship that archivists may draw upon to develop appropriate AI documentation practices. From the statistical social sciences and the visual heritage fields, the article discusses existing definitions of paradata and its ambiguous, often contextually dependent relationship with existing metadata categories. Approaching the problem from a sociotechnical perspective, literature on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) insists pointedly that explainability be attuned to specific users’ stated needs—needs that archivists may better articulate using the framework of paradata.

ID-1977,inproceedings,Real-World Scanpaths Exhibit Long-Term Temporal Dependencies: Considerations for Contextual AI for AR Applications,"All-day augmented reality (AR) requires contextually-aware artificial intelligence (AI) models that excel across diverse daily contexts. Eye tracking could be a key source of information about user context and intention. However, such models using gaze sometimes struggle to outperform egocentric video-based baseline models. We propose that learning representations of scanpath history in a perceptually-relevant state space may solve this problem. However, scanpaths are often assumed to obey a Markovian assumption, i.e., only the current and previous fixation matter. In a user study (30 participants; 26.2 hours total), we analyzed scanpaths during nine everyday tasks and identified long-term temporal dependencies, with an average timescale of four fixations (2 seconds) into the past (i.e., violating the Markovian assumption). We discovered substantial task-specific variations in these dependencies. This confirms that scanpaths contain stereotyped “motifs” with context-dependent lengths/timescales. We discuss the implications for designing contextual AI models for AR applications.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3649902.3656352,3,,,,,,,Charlie S Burlingham and Naveen Sendhilnathan and Xiuyun Wu and T Scott Murdison and Michael J Proulx,10.1145/3649902.3656352,,,,"All-day AR,Contextual AI,Deep learning,Gaze,Information theory,Pervasive eye tracking,Scanpath,Temporal dependencies",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3649902.3656352,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1978,inproceedings,Exploring Perspectives on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Creativity of Knowledge Work: Beyond Mechanised Plagiarism and Stochastic Parrots,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), and in particular generative models, are transformative tools for knowledge work. They problematise notions of creativity, originality, plagiarism, the attribution of credit, and copyright ownership. Critics of generative models emphasise the reliance on large amounts of training data, and view the output of these models as no more than randomised plagiarism, remix, or collage of the source data. On these grounds many have argued for stronger regulations on the deployment, use, and attribution of the output of these models. However, these issues are not new or unique to artificial intelligence. In this position paper, using examples from literary criticism, the history of art, and copyright law, I show how creativity and originality resist definition as a notatable or information-theoretic property of an object, and instead can be seen as the property of a process, an author, or a viewer. Further alternative views hold that all creative work is essentially reuse (mostly without attribution), or that randomness itself can be creative. I suggest that creativity is ultimately defined by communities of creators and receivers, and the deemed sources of creativity in a workflow often depend on which parts of the workflow can be automated. Using examples from recent studies of AI in creative knowledge work, I suggest that AI shifts knowledge work from material production to critical integration. This position paper aims to begin a conversation around a more nuanced approach to the problems of creativity and credit assignment for generative models, one which more fully recognises the importance of the creative and curatorial voice of the users of these models, and moves away from simpler notational or information-theoretic views.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3596671.3597650,3,,,,,,,Advait Sarkar,10.1145/3596671.3597650,,,,critical theory,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3596671.3597650,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

HPC platforms can perform extreme-scale simulations, combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) training and inference and data analytics (we refer to heterogeneous workflows), by providing tools and computing resources which serve a variety of use-cases spanning very diverse application domains (e.g., weather forecasting, quantum mechanics, etc.). Executing such workflows at scale requires to handle dependencies, job submission automation, I/O mechanisms.

Our results show that, while the impact of initial observation time on AI-assisted decision-making was dependent on task nature, participants were more likely to follow AI suggestions when they were provided with longer final decision time; moreover, although participants generally tended to adhere to their initial responses, they had more agency when they were more logically engaged in a task.

Our contribution seeks to scrutinize physicians’ engagement with AI by interviewing 7 medical-imaging experts and disentangle its future alignment across the clinical and research workflows, diverging from the existing “one-size-fits-all” paradigm within Human-Centered AI discourses. Our analysis revealed that physicians’ trust in AI is less dependent on their general acceptance of AI, but more on their contestable experiences with AI. Contestability, in clinical workflows, underpins the need for personal supervision of AI outcomes and processes, i.e., clinician-in-the-loop.

Real-time macronutrient analysis using the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) is essential for crop and fertilizer optimization because soil quality is crucial to plant growth and productivity. This study proposes a novel parallel-hybrid CNN-LSTM model with Bayesian optimization for smart agriculture soil nutrient management. Modern farming relies on resource efficiency and waste reduction. IoT technology helps farmers integrate smart farming practices for real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making. With IoT sensors, soil data like macronutrient levels, soil temperature, and pH values are continuously collected to assess soil health. The hybrid model better captures spatial patterns and temporal dependencies in sequential data, matching soil nutrient and environmental data. Based on real-time soil nutrient data, the proposed approach identified suitable crops and fertilizers with 99.12% accuracy after rigorous experimentation and evaluation. The parallel-hybrid CNN-LSTM model and Bayesian optimization make precise and timely decisions for optimal crop growth and resource management in smart agriculture, as shown by this high accuracy rate.

ID-1987,inproceedings,The Role of Explainability in Collaborative Human-AI Disinformation Detection,"Manual verification has become very challenging based on the increasing volume of information shared online and the role of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Thus, AI systems are used to identify disinformation and deep fakes online. Previous research has shown that superior performance can be observed when combining AI and human expertise. Moreover, according to the EU AI Act, human oversight is inevitable when using AI systems in a domain where fundamental human rights, such as the right to free expression, might be affected. Thus, AI systems need to be transparent and offer sufficient explanations to be comprehensible. Much research has been done on integrating eXplainability (XAI) features to increase the transparency of AI systems; however, they lack human-centered evaluation. Additionally, the meaningfulness of explanations varies depending on users’ background knowledge and individual factors. Thus, this research implements a human-centered evaluation schema to evaluate different XAI features for the collaborative human-AI disinformation detection task. Hereby, objective and subjective evaluation dimensions, such as performance, perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust in the AI system, are used to evaluate different XAI features. A user study was conducted with an overall total of 433 participants, whereas 406 crowdworkers and 27 journalists participated as experts in detecting disinformation. The results show that free-text explanations contribute to improving non-expert performance but do not influence the performance of experts. The XAI features increase the perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust in the AI system, but they can also lead crowdworkers to blindly trust the AI system when its predictions are wrong.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630106.3659031,3,,,,,,,Vera Schmitt and Luis-Felipe Villa-Arenas and Nils Feldhus and Joachim Meyer and Robert P Spang and Sebastian Möller,10.1145/3630106.3659031,,,,"Collaborative disinformation detection,XAI,expert and lay people evaluation,transparent AI systems",,,2157-2174,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3630106.3659031,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1990,article,Effects of AI and Logic-Style Explanations on Users’ Decisions Under Different Levels of Uncertainty,"Existing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques support people in interpreting AI advice. However, although previous work evaluates the users’ understanding of explanations, factors influencing the decision support are largely overlooked in the literature. This article addresses this gap by studying the impact of user uncertainty, AI correctness, and the interaction between AI uncertainty and explanation logic-styles for classification tasks. We conducted two separate studies: one requesting participants to recognize handwritten digits and one to classify the sentiment of reviews. To assess the decision making, we analyzed the task performance, agreement with the AI suggestion, and the user’s reliance on the XAI interface elements. Participants make their decision relying on three pieces of information in the XAI interface (image or text instance, AI prediction, and explanation). Participants were shown one explanation style (between-participants design) according to three styles of logical reasoning (inductive, deductive, and abductive). This allowed us to study how different levels of AI uncertainty influence the effectiveness of different explanation styles. The results show that user uncertainty and AI correctness on predictions significantly affected users’ classification decisions considering the analyzed metrics. In both domains (images and text), users relied mainly on the instance to decide. Users were usually overconfident about their choices, and this evidence was more pronounced for text. Furthermore, the inductive style explanations led to overreliance on the AI advice in both domains—it was the most persuasive, even when the AI was incorrect. The abductive and deductive styles have complex effects depending on the domain and the AI uncertainty levels.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3588320,3,,,,,,"RQ1: Does the user Reliance on the explanation, instance, and AI prediction depend on the User Uncertainty level?

These limitations are caused by the high privacy concerns in the medical field and the requirement of getting aid from experts for the time-consuming and costly medical data annotation process. In computer vision, image synthesis has made a significant contribution in recent years, as a result of the progress of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). Novel DPMs have outperformed GANs in text, image, and video generation tasks. Therefore, this study proposes a conditional DPM framework to generate synthetic gastrointestinal (GI) polyp images conditioned on given generated segmentation masks. Our experimental results show that our system can generate an unlimited number of high-fidelity synthetic polyp images with the corresponding ground truth masks of polyps. To test the usefulness of the generated data we trained binary image segmentation models to study the effect of using synthetic data. Results show that the best micro-imagewise intersection over union (IOU) of 0.7751 was achieved from DeepLabv3+ when the training data consists of both real data and synthetic data.

ID-1993,inproceedings,Endangered Tujia language Speech Recognition Research based on Audio-Visual Fusion,"As an endangered language, Tujia language is a non-renewable intangible cultural resource. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) uses artificial intelligence technology to facilitate manually label Tujia language, which is an effective means to protect this language. However, due to the fact that Tujia language has few native speakers, few labeled corpus, and much noise in the corpus. The acoustic models thus suffer from over fitting and lowe noise immunity, which seriously harms the accuracy of recognition. To tackle the deficiencies, an approach of audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) based on Transformer-CTC is proposed, which reduces the dependence of acoustic models on noise and the quantity of data by introducing visual modality in-formation including lip movements. Specifically, the new approach enhances the expression of speakers’ feature space through the fusion of audio and visual information, thus solving the problem of less available information for single modality. Experiment results show that the optimal CER of AVSR is 8.2% lower than that of traditional models, and 11.8% lower than that for lip reading.

We interviewed 20 healthcare providers in asthma care to envision future technologies to support their PGHD use. We found that healthcare providers want future artificial intelligence (AI) systems to enhance their ability to treat patients by analyzing PGHD for profiling risk and predicting deterioration. Despite the potential benefits of AI, providers perceived various challenges of AI use with PGHD, including AI-driven data inequity, added burden, lack of trust toward AI, and fear of being replaced by AI. Clinicians wished for a future of co-dependent human-AI collaboration, where AI will help them to improve their clinical practice. In turn, healthcare providers can improve AI systems by making AI outputs more trustworthy and humane. Through the lens of data feminism, we discuss the importance of considering context and aligning the complex human infrastructure before designing or deploying PGHD-based AI systems in clinical settings.

ID-1995,inproceedings,A Synthetic Dataset Generation for the Uveitis Pathology Based on MedWGAN Model,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undergone considerable development in recent years in the field of medicine and in particular in decision support diagnostic. However, the development of such algorithms depends on the presence of a sufficiently large amount of data to provide reliable results. Unfortunately in medicine, it is not always possible to provide so much data on all pathologies. This problem is particularly true for rare diseases. In this paper we focus on uveitis, a rare disease in ophthalmology which is the third cause of blindness worldwide. This pathology is difficult to diagnose because of the disparity in prevalence of its etiologies. In order to provide physicians with a diagnostic aid system, it would be necessary to have a representative dataset of epidemiological profiles that have been studied for a long time in this domain. This work proposes a breakthrough in this field by suggesting a methodological framework for the generation of an open source dataset based on the crossing of several epidemiological profiles and using data augmentation techniques. The results of these generated synthetic data have been qualitatively validated by specialist physicians in ophthalmology. Our results are very promising and consist in a first brick to promote research in AI on Uveitis disease.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3555776.3577648,3,,,,,,,Heithem Sliman and Imen Megdiche and Sami Yangui and Aida Drira and Ines Drira and Elyes Lamine,10.1145/3555776.3577648,,,,"data augmentation,decision support systems,synthetic datasets",,,559-566,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3555776.3577648,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-1996,inproceedings,Network intelligence in 6G: challenges and opportunities,"The success of the upcoming 6G systems will largely depend on the quality of the Network Intelligence (NI) that will fully automate network management. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are commonly regarded as the cornerstone for NI design, as they have proven extremely successful at solving hard problems that require inferring complex relationships from entangled, massive (network traffic) data. However, the common approach of plugging ‘vanilla’ AI models into controllers and orchestrators does not fulfil the potential of the technology. Instead, AI models should be tailored to the specific network level and respond to the specific needs of network functions, eventually coordinated by an end-to-end NI-native architecture for 6G. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and provide results for a candidate NI-driven functionality that is properly integrated into the proposed architecture: network capacity forecasting.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3477091.3482761,3,,,,,,,Albert Banchs and Marco Fiore and Andres Garcia-Saavedra and Marco Gramaglia,10.1145/3477091.3482761,,,,"6G,mobile networks,network intelligence",,,7-12,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3477091.3482761,2021,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-1998,inproceedings,Carbon-Efficient Design Optimization for Computing Systems,"The world's push toward an environmentally sustainable society is highly dependent on the semiconductor industry, due to carbon footprints of global-scale sources such as computing systems for virtual and extended reality applications (VR and XR). Despite previous carbon modeling efforts for such computing systems, there lacks a wide range of design tools to optimize total life cycle carbon footprint (during manufacturing and also during day-to-day operation), while meeting application-level constraints (power, performance, area). To address this need, we have developed a carbon-aware design framework that optimizes carbon efficiency of computing systems—quantified by metrics such as total Carbon Delay Product (tCDP: the product of total carbon and total application execution time)—while also identifying key design parameters for improving carbon efficiency. As a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework to improve tCDP of hardware accelerators for artificial intelligence (AI) and XR applications. We show: (1) optimizing for carbon efficiency (tCDP) instead of energy efficiency (Energy-Delay Product or EDP) improves carbon efficiency by up to 6.9—i.e., optimizing for EDP is insufficient; (2) for multi-core CPUs inside production VR headsets, optimizing number of cores (from 8 to 4) improves tCDP by 1.25 (over their entire lifetime); (3) leveraging an advanced three-dimensional integration (3D) technique (3D stacking of separately-fabricated logic and memory chips) can improve tCDP by 6.9 vs. conventional systems (no 3D stacking).",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3604930.3605712,3,,,,,,,Mariam Elgamal and Doug Carmean and Elnaz Ansari and Okay Zed and Ramesh Peri and Srilatha Manne and Udit Gupta and Gu-Yeon Wei and David Brooks and Gage Hills and Carole-Jean Wu,10.1145/3604930.3605712,,,,"carbon-efficient optimization,sustainable computing systems",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3604930.3605712,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-2000,article,Sustaining the High Performance of AI-Based Network Traffic Classification Models,"Network traffic classification plays an essential role in network measurement and management. Emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms have become a viable solution to encrypted network traffic classification. Nonetheless, the classification performance of existing AI-based traffic classifiers is restricted to a limited number of network applications depending on the coverage of the knowledge database. Such AI-based traffic classifiers cannot maintain high performance to provide accurate traffic classification when dealing with updated or new network applications. To tackle the issues, we present an autonomous model update mechanism to sustain the high performance of AI-based traffic classifiers. Specifically, an instability check algorithm is derived to evaluate if the current classifier requires an update. A filtering algorithm is proposed to extract unknown traffic and build a new knowledge database based on a new metric, i.e., familiarity, defined based on the prediction confidence and instability. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our proposed updating mechanism can provide prompt model updates and establish a proper new knowledge base to maintain high accuracy in various experimental scenarios. Moreover, the comparison is conducted and the results show the proposed familiarity-based filtering algorithm can filter about 7 and 3 times more true positive packets in the two considered scenarios, respectively.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1109/TNET.2022.3203227,3,,,,,,,Jielun Zhang and Fuhao Li and Feng Ye,10.1109/TNET.2022.3203227,1063-6692,2,IEEE/ACM Trans.

ID-2002,inproceedings,DRAEC: An Adaptive Edge Computing Framework for Enforcing Operational Policy in CPS-IoT Systems,"As Cyber Physical-Internet of Things Systems (CPS-IoT Systems) continue to advance, we have noticed an expansion of the variety of entity types deployed in these systems. With this expansion, the complexity of handling vastly different communication protocols, processes, and data within the system in a timely manner has become a significant challenge. One potential method of quickly processing this data is to push essential computation concerning the Transitional State Change (TSC) feedback loop from the cloud to the edge of the system. In this paper, we propose DRAEC, a novel edge computing framework that uses agent-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Complex-Event Processing (CEP) to significantly decrease the latency of the TSC feedback loop and subsequently increase the system’s scalability. This increase in performance is achieved by using a CEP system to synthesize discreet events from CPS-IoT entity telemetry, which our novel Dynamic Reactive Agent then uses to quickly generate and enforce controls on a user’s physical environment via a user-defined operational policy. We then present supporting results, showing that our novel edge computing framework enables a CPS-IoT control system to outperform a cloud-centric variant by 20-43x (depending on the connection type) when comparing the latency of the TSC feedback loop; it also enables support of significantly larger scale (10-100x) systems while maintaining the same level of service as the cloud-centric version.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3576914.3587509,3,,,,,,,Jared Hall and Joe Sventek,10.1145/3576914.3587509,,,,"Artificial Intelligence,Cloud Computing,Complex Event Processing,Cyber-Physical Systems,Edge computing,Internet of Things,IoT policy Enforcement",,,203-208,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3576914.3587509,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2003,inproceedings,Towards fluid software architectures: bidirectional human-AI interaction,"The research on engineering software applications that employ artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is at an all-time peak. However, most of the research in this area is focused on the interactions between humans and AI which, in turn, is predominantly concerned with either building immersive interfaces and user experiences that allow for increased telemetry or on handling AI and ML applications in production (MLOps). Nonetheless, the research on fundamental architectural differences between AI-powered applications and traditional ones did not receive its fair share of attention. To that end, we believe that a new take on the fundamental architecture of building software applications is needed. With the ever increasing prominence of content-driven AI-powered applications, it is our conviction that 1) content could be served by servers without clients requesting, 2) servers could (should) request data from clients without waiting for their requests, and 3) interfaces should dynamically adapt to updates that happen to the intelligence driving the application. Hence, in this paper, we propose the fluid architecture that facilitates the bidirectional interaction between clients and servers as well as accommodates the co-dependent evolution of interfaces and back-end intelligence in AI-powered systems.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678647,3,,,,,,,Ammar Yasser and Mervat Abu-Elkhier,10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678647,,,,"AI-powered systems,artificial intelligence,human-AI interaction,software architecture",,,1368-1372,,IEEE Press,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678647,2022,,
ID-2004,article,Enhancing Human-in-the-Loop Ontology Curation Results through Task Design,"The success of artificial intelligence (AI) applications is heavily dependent on the quality of data they rely on. Thus, data curation, dealing with cleaning, organising, and managing data, has become a significant research area to be addressed. Increasingly, semantic data structures such as ontologies and knowledge graphs empower the new generation of AI systems. In this article, we focus on ontologies as a special type of data. Ontologies are conceptual data structures representing a domain of interest and are often used as a backbone to knowledge-based intelligent systems or as an additional input for machine learning algorithms. Low-quality ontologies, containing incorrectly represented information or controversial concepts modelled from a single viewpoint, can lead to invalid application outputs and biased systems. Thus, we focus on the curation of ontologies as a crucial factor for ensuring trust in the enabled AI systems. While some ontology quality aspects can be automatically evaluated, others require a human-in-the-loop evaluation. Yet, despite the importance of the field, several ontology quality aspects have not yet been addressed and there is a lack of guidelines for optimal design of human computation tasks to perform such evaluations. In this article, we advance the state-of-the-art by making two novel contributions. First, we propose a human computation (HC)–based approach for the verification of ontology restrictions —an ontology evaluation aspect that has not yet been addressed with HC techniques. Second, by performing two controlled experiments with a junior expert crowd, we empirically derive task design guidelines for achieving high-quality evaluation results related to (i) the formalism for representing ontology axioms and (ii) crowd qualification testing. We find that the representation format of the ontology does not significantly influence the campaign results. Nevertheless, contributors expressed a preference in working with a graphical ontology representation. Additionally, we show that an objective qualification test is better fitted at assessing contributors’ prior knowledge rather than a subjective self-assessment and that prior modelling knowledge of the contributors had a positive effect on their judgements.

ID-2009,inproceedings,"Transforming IoT Data Preprocessing: A Holistic, Normalized and Distributed Approach","Data preprocessing is an integral part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) pipelines. It transforms raw data into input data that fulfill algorithmic criteria and improve prediction accuracy. As the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) gains more momentum, the data volume generated from the edge is exponentially increasing that far exceeds any expansion of infrastructure. Social responsibilities and regulations (e.g., GDPR) must also be adhered when handling IoT data. In addition, we are currently witnessing a shift towards distributing AI to the edge. The aforementioned reasons render the distribution of data preprocessing to the edge an urgent requirement. In this paper, we introduce a modern data preprocessing framework that consists of two main parts. Part1 is a design tool that reduces the complexity and costs of the data preprocessing phase for AI via generalization and normalization. The design tool is a standard template that maps specific techniques into abstract categories and highlights dependencies between them. In addition, it presents a holistic notion of data preprocessing that is not limited to data cleaning. The second part is an IoT tool that adopts the edge-cloud collaboration model to progressively improve the quality of the data. It includes a synchronization mechanism that ensures adaptation to changes in data characteristics and a coordination mechanism that ensures correct and complete execution of preprocessing plans between the cloud and the edge. The paper includes an empirical analysis of the framework using a developed prototype and an automotive use-case.

ID-2012,inproceedings,An Updated Model of Trust and Trustworthiness for the use of Digital Technologies and Artificial Intelligence in City Making,"Although digital technologies that inform city making are seen as tools to enhance democratic processes in the decision-making inherent in placemaking, these technologies are critically dependent on trusted relationships and play a role as trustworthy channels of communication between urban planners, policy makers and communities. This paper examines how the existing use of digital technologies in city making signals trustworthiness in both the design and deployment of such technologies, and considers how the increasing use of artificial intelligence (‘AI’) will require careful implementation of benevolent transparency processes. The paper presents an updated model of trustworthiness for the use of digital technologies and AI in city making based on Mayer et al's (1995) widely-cited integrative model of trust (the ‘ABI model’). It begins with an analysis of the need for greater demonstrations of trustworthiness as digital technologies are equipped with AI. The paper then introduces the ABI model, breaking down the components of trust in interpersonal contexts to focus on the perceived factors of trustworthiness: ability, benevolence and integrity. Ability considers the technical competence of the recipient of trust (the ‘trustee’). In the context of city making, this trustee would be the urban planner, policy maker or technology developer, and their ability to design and deploy these digital technologies and AI in city making. Benevolence considers whether or not the trustee holds a positive orientation or intention towards the member of the community who is the intended giver of trust (the ‘trustor’). Integrity considers whether or not the trustor and trustee subscribe to a common set of values. This paper argues that the germinal component of trustworthiness lies in signals of benevolence as articulated in transparency practices that demonstrate mutual vulnerability, consensus formation and seamful decision-making processes. These benevolent qualities of transparency practices are mapped onto existing uses of digital technologies in city making to demonstrate how the updated model of trust and trustworthiness can help visualise the signals of trustworthiness as AI is increasingly embedded in these digital technologies.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3627611.3627618,3,,,,,,,Brydon T Wang,10.1145/3627611.3627618,,,,,,,69-80,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3627611.3627618,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2013,inproceedings,"Female, white, 27? Bias Evaluation on Data and Algorithms for Affect Recognition in Faces","Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms show a strong performance for many use cases, making them desirable for real-world scenarios where the algorithms provide high-impact decisions. However, one major drawback of AI algorithms is their susceptibility to bias and resulting unfairness. This has a huge influence for their application, as they have a higher failure rate for certain subgroups. In this paper, we focus on the field of affective computing and particularly on the detection of bias for facial expressions. Depending on the deployment scenario, bias in facial expression models can have a disadvantageous impact and it is therefore essential to evaluate the bias and limitations of the model. In order to analyze the metadata distribution in affective computing datasets, we annotate several benchmark training datasets, containing both Action Units and categorical emotions, with age, gender, ethnicity, glasses, and beards. We show that there is a significantly skewed distribution, particularly for ethnicity and age. Based on this metadata annotation, we evaluate two trained state-of-the-art affective computing algorithms. Our evaluation shows that the strongest bias is in age, with the best performance for persons under 34 and a sharp decrease for older persons. Furthermore, we see an ethnicity bias with varying direction depending on the algorithm, a slight gender bias and worse performance for facial parts occluded by glasses.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3531146.3533159,3,,,,,,,Jaspar Pahl and Ines Rieger and Anna Möller and Thomas Wittenberg and Ute Schmid,10.1145/3531146.3533159,,,,"action units,affective computing,algorithm evaluation,bias,categorical emotions,data evaluation,fairness,metadata post-annotation",,,973-987,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3531146.3533159,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2014,inproceedings,Improvement of Detection Rate for Small Objects Using Pre-processing Network,Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developing in a variety of methods over the past decade. However most AI experts worried to build a deep or wide network because the accuracy of AI models depends heavily on the depth of the network. In general deep and wide networks are better at learning than those that are less deep and wide and wide. On the other hand deeper networks are more complex and have many disadvantages such as computational cost and system specification dependency. We propose a novel method to improve the average recall rate for small objects in the deep convolutional network in the paper. The proposed method added pre-processing layer before the network rather than stacking the networks deeper or wide. The presented pre-processing layer consists of two major parts: up-sampling and down-sampling of the data. The overall objective of up-sampling and down-sampling is to enhance the resolution of small objects in the input image. The pre-processing network improves the average recall rate of the base network to 3.56%. This experiment result depicts that the proposed method outperforms the small object detection performance.CCS CONCEPTS • Computing methodologies • Object detection,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3484274.3484283,3,,,,,,,Doo Hee Lee and Gi Soon Cha and Ehtesham Iqbal and Hyun Chul Song and Kwang Nam Choi,10.1145/3484274.3484283,,,,"COCO dataset,Coordinate Convolutional,Object Detection,pre-processing network",,,50-56,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3484274.3484283,2021,"New York, NY, USA",

Here, we examine trust in AI in the context of a human-AI partnership that involves a joint decision making task for estimating levels of public speaking anxiety based on speech signals. The AI system is comprised of an explainable machine learning (ML) algorithm, that takes acoustic characteristics as input and outputs the estimate of public speaking anxiety levels, a local explanation about the most important features that contributed to the decision of each speech sample, and a global explanation about the most important features for the data overall. We analyze interactions between AI and human annotators with background in psychological sciences, and measure trust over time via the annotators’ agreement with the AI model and the annotators’ self-reports. We further examine factors of trust that are related to the characteristics of the human annotator and the ML algorithm. Results indicate that trust in AI depends on the openness level of the annotator and the importance level of input features. Findings from this study can provide guidelines to designing solutions that properly calibrate human trust in AI in collaborative human-AI tasks.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3462244.3479926,3,,,,,,,Abdullah Aman Tutul and Ehsanul Haque Nirjhar and Theodora Chaspari,10.1145/3462244.3479926,,,,"Trustworthy AI,human-AI interaction,public speaking anxiety,speech",,,288-296,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3462244.3479926,2021,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2016,inproceedings,Invisible Influence: Artificial Intelligence and the Ethics of Adaptive Choice Architectures,"For several years, scholars have (for good reason) been largely preoccupied with worries about the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools to make decisions about us. Only recently has significant attention turned to a potentially more alarming problem: the use of AI/ML to influence our decision-making. The contexts in which we make decisions–what behavioral economists call our choice architectures–are increasingly technologically-laden. Which is to say: algorithms increasingly determine, in a wide variety of contexts, both the sets of options we choose from and the way those options are framed. Moreover, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) makes it possible for those options and their framings–the choice architectures–to be tailored to the individual chooser. They are constructed based on information collected about our individual preferences, interests, aspirations, and vulnerabilities, with the goal of influencing our decisions. At the same time, because we are habituated to these technologies we pay them little notice. They are, as philosophers of technology put it, transparent to us–effectively invisible. I argue that this invisible layer of technological mediation, which structures and influences our decision-making, renders us deeply susceptible to manipulation. Absent a guarantee that these technologies are not being used to manipulate and exploit, individuals will have little reason to trust them.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3306618.3314286,3,,,,,,,Daniel Susser,10.1145/3306618.3314286,,,,"accountability,choice architecture,data ethics,influence,manipulation,transparency",,,403-408,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3306618.3314286,2019,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2017,inproceedings,Vulnerability detection with fine-grained interpretations,"Despite the successes of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based vulnerability detectors (VD), they are limited to providing only the decision on whether a given code is vulnerable or not, without details on what part of the code is relevant to the detected vulnerability. We present IVDetect, an interpretable vulnerability detector with the philosophy of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect vulnerabilities, while using Intelligence Assistant (IA) to provide VD interpretations in terms of vulnerable statements.  For vulnerability detection, we separately consider the vulnerable statements and their surrounding contexts via data and control dependencies. This allows our model better discriminate vulnerable statements than using the mixture of vulnerable code and contextual code as in existing approaches. In addition to the coarse-grained vulnerability detection result, we leverage interpretable AI to provide users with fine-grained interpretations that include the sub-graph in the Program Dependency Graph (PDG) with the crucial statements that are relevant to the detected vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation on vulnerability databases shows that IVDetect outperforms the existing DL-based approaches by 43%–84% and 105%–255% in top-10 nDCG and MAP ranking scores. IVDetect correctly points out the vulnerable statements relevant to the vulnerability via its interpretation in 67% of the cases with a top-5 ranked list.

It allows building AI/ML algorithms for computer vision, speech processing, and other timeseries analytics tasks with limited domain knowledge. As there is no mechanism to control the representations learned from a large dataset, it becomes hard to predict whether a very small DL model can learn the proper dependencies needed for a particular problem at hand.With speech recognition capability becoming important in several Internet of Things (IoT) devices, we propose an explainable AI-based methodology to build small DL models for speech recognition by controlling the representations learned by a model under a hard size constraint.We enhance the architecture of a state of the art sequence transduction model to allow the tuning of accuracy vs. model size trade-off.

ID-2019,inproceedings,The challenges of providing explanations of AI systems when they do not behave like users expect,"Explanations in artificial intelligence (AI) ensure that users of complex AI systems understand why the system behaves as it does. Expectations that users may have about the system behaviour play a role since they co-determine appropriate content of the explanations. In this paper, we investigate user-desired content of explanations when the system behaves in unexpected ways. Specifically, we presented participants with various scenarios involving an automated text classifier and then asked them to indicate their preferred explanation in each scenario. One group of participants chose the type of explanation from a multiple-choice questionnaire, the other had to answer using free text. Participants show a pretty clear agreement regarding the preferred type of explanation when the output matches expectations: most do not require an explanation at all, while those that do would like one that explains what features of the input led to the output (a factual explanation). When the output does not match expectations, users also prefer different explanations. Interestingly, there is less of an agreement in the multiple-choice questionnaire. However, the free text responses indicate slightly favour an explanation that describes how the AI system’s internal workings led to the observed output (i.e., a mechanistic explanation). Overall, we demonstrate that user expectations are a significant variable in determining the most suitable content of explanations (including whether an explanation is needed at all). We also find different results, especially when the output does not match expectations, depending on whether participants answered via multiple-choice or free text.

It is widely used for predicting students' performance and building knowledge graph, which plays an important role in constructing adaptive (personalized) teaching systems. Previous models can not deal with subjective problems, and the performance is somewhat poor when input exercise sequences are long. In this paper, we propose a knowledge tracing model for subjective problems based on Transformer-XL, which can predict students' performance of a specific exercise.

ID-2022,inproceedings,Explainable AI for software engineering,"The success of software engineering projects largely depends on complex decision-making. For example, which tasks should a developer do first, who should perform this task, is the software of high quality, is a software system reliable and resilient enough to deploy, etc. However, erroneous decision-making for these complex questions is costly in terms of money and reputation. Thus, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques have been widely used in software engineering for developing software analytics tools and techniques to improve decision-making, developer productivity, and software quality. However, the predictions of such AI/ML models for software engineering are still not practical (i.e., coarse-grained), not explainable, and not actionable. These concerns often hinder the adoption of AI/ML models in software engineering practices. In addition, many recent studies still focus on improving the accuracy, while a few of them focus on improving explainability. Are we moving in the right direction? How can we better improve the SE community (both research and education)?In this tutorial, we first provide a concise yet essential introduction to the most important aspects of Explainable AI and a hands-on tutorial of Explainable AI tools and techniques.

ID-2023,article,Research on pattern recognition of different music types in the context of AI with the help of multimedia information processing,"Music is a form of art in which the sounds are timed and organized. Music is a kind of entertainment that mixes sounds in a way that people like, find fascinating, or to which they desire to dance. Most music is created via one or more people's vocal or instrumental efforts. By the dictionary, music is defined as having at least one of the following three elements: rhythm, melody, and harmony. Music is utilized in therapy because of its apparent benefits on behavior. Various physiological circumstances have different metabolite expression patterns that can be studied using pattern recognition in multimedia information processing. Music therapy includes various activities, including singing, playing instruments, dancing, and listening to music. Music-making with artificial intelligence (AI) uses neural networks, which are massive collections of computer bits that aim to stimulate brain activity. The neural network (NN) may be bombarded with music to see if it picks up on patterns the way the human brain does when repeatedly exposed to new stimuli. It will get the hang of them eventually. Experts believed that AI would be unable to generate music unless it first mimics a human-created data collection. By providing a conceptual paradigm for multimedia information processing. The end effect will be entirely different depending on how many hours of music are placed into it. For AI to learn from patterns or features in data on its own, it needs big data (BD), fast, repeated processing, and complex algorithms. The use of technology makes the process of creating analytical models much faster. A new AI-BD tool is an opportunity, not a danger for people currently working as artists. People are beginning to ask what constitutes acceptable work as AI grows more prominent in the music and art industries to gain efficiency of 97.8%. Future music will be heavily impacted by listeners' bodies and emotions all the time. For example, wearable technology may detect a person's mood and play the music that matches it. It is the next step in personalization. The AI-BD methodology improves the efficiency, accuracy, etc., compared to other existing models by gaining 97.8%, performance analysis 97.2%, reliability ratio 95.6%, and survivability analysis 98.2%.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3523284,3,,,,,,,Wei Sun and Revathi Sundarasekar,10.1145/3523284,2375-4699,,ACM Trans.

ID-2027,article,The Design of Reciprocal Learning Between Human and Artificial Intelligence,"The need for advanced automation and artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, including text classification, has dramatically increased in the last decade, leaving us critically dependent on their performance and reliability. Yet, as we increasingly rely more on AI applications, their algorithms are becoming more nuanced, more complex, and less understandable precisely at a time we need to understand them better and trust them to perform as expected. Text classification in the medical and cybersecurity domains is a good example of a task where we may wish to keep the human in the loop. Human experts lack the capacity to deal with the high volume and velocity of data that needs to be classified, and ML techniques are often unexplainable and lack the ability to capture the required context needed to make the right decision and take action. We propose a new abstract configuration of Human-Machine Learning (HML) that focuses on reciprocal learning, where the human and the AI are collaborating partners. We employ design-science research (DSR) to learn and design an application of the HML configuration, which incorporates software to support combining human and artificial intelligences. We define the HML configuration by its conceptual components and their function. We then describe the development of a system called Fusion that supports human-machine reciprocal learning. Using two case studies of text classification from the cyber domain, we evaluate Fusion and the proposed HML approach, demonstrating benefits and challenges. Our results show a clear ability of domain experts to improve the ML classification performance over time, while both human and machine, collaboratively, develop their conceptualization, i.e., their knowledge of classification. We generalize our insights from the DSR process as actionable principles for researchers and designers of 'human in the learning loop' systems. We conclude the paper by discussing HML configurations and the challenge of capturing and representing knowledge gained jointly by human and machine, an area we feel has great potential.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3479587,3,,,,,,,Alexey Zagalsky and Dov Te'eni and Inbal Yahav and David G Schwartz and Gahl Silverman and Daniel Cohen and Yossi Mann and Dafna Lewinsky,10.1145/3479587,,CSCW2,Proc.

ID-2028,inproceedings,"A Comparison of SYCL, OpenCL, CUDA, and OpenMP for Massively Parallel Support Vector Machine Classification on Multi-Vendor Hardware","In scientific computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI), which both rely on massively parallel tasks, frameworks like the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) are widely used to harvest the computational power of accelerator cards, in particular of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). A few years ago, GPUs from NVIDIA were used almost exclusively for these tasks but meanwhile, AMD and Intel are increasing their shares of the GPUs market. This introduces many new challenges for code development, as the prevailing CUDA code can only run on NVIDIA hardware and must be adapted or even completely rewritten to run on GPUs from AMD or Intel. In this paper, we compare the different competing programming frameworks OpenMP, CUDA, OpenCL, and SYCL, paying special attention to the two SYCL implementations hipSYCL and DPC++. Thereby, we investigate the different frameworks with respect to their usability, performance, and performance portability on a variety of hardware platforms from different vendors, i.e., GPUs from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel and Central Processing Units (CPUs) from AMD and Intel. Besides discussing the runtimes of these frameworks on the different hardware platforms, we also focus our comparison on the differences between the nd_range kernel formulation and the SYCL specific hierarchical kernels. Our Parallel Least Squares Support Vector Machine (PLSSVM) library implements backends for the four previously mentioned programming frameworks for a Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs). At its example, we show which of the frameworks is best suited for a standard workload that is frequently employed in scientific computing and AI, depending on the target hardware: The most computationally intensive part of our PLSSVM library is solving a system of linear equations using the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method. Specifically, we parallelize the implicit matrix-vector multiplication inside the CG method, a workload common in many scientific codes.

ID-2029,inproceedings,Should Artificial Intelligence Governance be Centralised? Design Lessons from History,"Can effective international governance for artificial intelligence remain fragmented, or is there a need for a centralised international organisation for AI? We draw on the history of other international regimes to identify advantages and disadvantages in centralising AI governance. Some considerations, such as efficiency and political power, speak in favour of centralisation. Conversely, the risk of creating a slow and brittle institution speaks against it, as does the difficulty in securing participation while creating stringent rules. Other considerations depend on the specific design of a centralised institution. A well-designed body may be able to deter forum shopping and ensure policy coordination. However, forum shopping can be beneficial and a fragmented landscape of institutions can be self-organising. Centralisation entails trade-offs and the details matter. We conclude with two core recommendations. First, the outcome will depend on the exact design of a central institution. A well-designed centralised regime covering a set of coherent issues could be beneficial. But locking-in an inadequate structure may pose a fate worse than fragmentation. Second, for now fragmentation will likely persist. This should be closely monitored to see if it is self-organising or simply inadequate.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3375627.3375857,3,,,,,,,Peter Cihon and Matthijs M Maas and Luke Kemp,10.1145/3375627.3375857,,,,"artificial intelligence policy,centralization,global governance,governance fragmentation,institutional design,regime complex",,,228-234,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3375627.3375857,2020,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2030,inproceedings,Ethically Aligned Opportunistic Scheduling for Productive Laziness,"In artificial intelligence (AI) mediated workforce management systems (e.g., crowdsourcing), long-term success depends on workers accomplishing tasks productively and resting well. This dual objective can be summarized by the concept of productive laziness. Existing scheduling approaches mostly focus on efficiency but overlook worker wellbeing through proper rest. In order to enable workforce management systems to follow the IEEE Ethically Aligned Design guidelines to prioritize worker wellbeing, we propose a distributed Computational Productive Laziness (CPL) approach in this paper. It intelligently recommends personalized work-rest schedules based on local data concerning a worker's capabilities and situational factors to incorporate opportunistic resting and achieve superlinear collective productivity without the need for explicit coordination messages. Extensive experiments based on a real-world dataset of over 5,000 workers demonstrate that CPL enables workers to spend 70% of the effort to complete 90% of the tasks on average, providing more ethically aligned scheduling than existing approaches.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3306618.3314240,3,,,,,,,Han Yu and Chunyan Miao and Yongqing Zheng and Lizhen Cui and Simon Fauvel and Cyril Leung,10.1145/3306618.3314240,,,,"crowdsourcing,mood,optimization,productive laziness,scheduling",,,45-51,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3306618.3314240,2019,"New York, NY, USA",

The common challenge being the variance at which advances in commercial and academic AI are deployed compared to rate of speed that innovative AI systems are developed and utilized in military domains. ISR, USAF and SOCOM need to develop a means to seamlessly integrate military and commercial state-of-the-art systems.

ID-2032,inproceedings,HitM: high-throughput ReRAM-based PIM for multi-modal neural networks,"With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, multi-modal deep neural networks (DNNs) have been applied to some challenging tasks, e.g., image and video description to process multi-modal information from vision and language. Resistive-memory-based processing-in-memory (ReRAM-based PIM) has been extensively studied to accelerate either convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN). According to the requirements of their core layers, i.e. convolutional layers and linear layers, the existing ReRAM-based PIMs adopt different optimization schemes for them. Directly deploying multi-modal DNNs on the existing ReRAM-based PIMs, however, is inefficient because multi-modal DNNs have combined CNN and RNN where the primary layers differ depending on the specific tasks. Therefore, a high-efficiency ReRAM-based PIM design for multi-modal DNNs necessitates an adaptive optimization to the given network. In this work, we propose HitM, a high-throughput ReRAM-based PIM for multi-modal DNNs with a two-stage workflow, which consists of a static analysis and an adaptive optimization. The static analysis generates the layer-wise resource and computation information with the input multi-modal DNN description and the adaptive optimization produces a high-throughput ReRAM-based PIM design through the dynamic algorithm based on hardware resources and the information from the static analysis. We evaluated HitM using several popular multi-modal DNNs with different parameters and structures and compared it with a na\""\{\i\}ve ReRAM-based PIM design and an optimal-throughput ReRAM-based PIM design that assumes no hardware resource limitations. The experimental results show that HitM averagely achieves 78.01% of the optimal throughput while consumes 64.52% of the total hardware resources.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3400302.3415663,3,,,,,,,Bing Li and Ying Wang and Yiran Chen,10.1145/3400302.3415663,,,,"ReRAM,accelerator,multi-modal neural networks,processing-in-memory",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3400302.3415663,2020,"New York, NY, USA",

As stated in the 2018 the UN E-Government Survey, major technological developments in software and hardware have enhanced the advancement of AI and its potential impact on society. Increased data collection and usage are magnifying the learning process of computers and improving the quality of AI systems which are heavily data-dependent. On the one hand, AI holds the promise to be a catalyst in accelerating development and allowing developing countries to leapfrog over some traditional obstacles. On the other hand, it brings along challenges such as its impact on the workforce, the ethical implications of some of its applications, and the need for capacity-building which would essentially overhaul the kind of education required for the next generation. This working paper analyzes the above issues from a public sector angle and raises questions which should be considered by public administrators and those working on digital government development in particular.

ID-2035,inproceedings,A deep multimodal investigation to determine the appropriateness of scholarly submissions,"Present day peer review is a time-consuming process and is still the only gatekeeper of scientific knowledge and wisdom. However, the rapid increase in research article submissions these days across different fields is posing significant challenges to the current system. Hence the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to better streamline the existing peer review system is an immediate need in this age of rapid scientific progress. Among many, one particular challenge these days is that the journal editors and conference program chairs are overwhelmed with the ever-increasing rise in article submissions. Studies show that a lot many submissions are not well-informed and do not fit within the scope of the intended journal or conference. Here in this work, we embark on to investigate how an AI could assist the editors and program chairs to identify potential out-of-scope submissions based on the past accepted papers of the particular journal or conference. We design a multimodal deep neural architecture and investigate the role of every possible channel of information in a research article (full-text, bibliography, images) to determine its appropriateness to the concerned venue. Our approach does not involve any handcrafted features, solely depends on the past accepting activity of the venue, and thereby achieves significant performance on two real-life datasets.

ID-2036,inproceedings,Reboot-Oriented IoT: Life Cycle Management in Trusted Execution Environment for Disposable IoT devices,"Many IoT devices are geographically distributed without human administrators, which are maintained by a remote server to enforce security updates, ideally through machine-to-machine (M2M) management. However, malware often terminates the remote control mechanism immediately after compromise and hijacks the device completely. The compromised device has no way to recover and becomes part of a botnet. Even if the IoT device remains uncompromised, it is required to update due to recall or other reasons. In addition, the device is desired to be automatically disposable after the expiration of its service, software, or device hardware to prevent being cyber debris. We present Reboot-Oriented IoT (RO-IoT), which updates the total OS image autonomously to recover from compromise (rootkit or otherwise), and manages the life cycle of the device using Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and PKI-based certificates (i.e., CA, server, and client certificates which are linked to device, software, and service). RO-IoT is composed of three TEE-protected components: the secure network bootloader, periodic memory forensics, and life cycle management. The secure network bootloader downloads and verifies the OS image by the TEE. The periodic memory forensics causes a hardware system-reset (i.e., reboot) after detecting any un-registered binary or a time-out, which depends on a TEE-protected watchdog timer. The life cycle management checks the expiration of PKI-based certificates for the device, software, and service, and deactivates the device if necessary. These features complement each other, and all binaries and certificates are encrypted or protected by TEE. We implemented a prototype of RO-IoT on an ARM Hikey board with the open source trusted OS OP-TEE. The design and implementation take account of availability (over 99.9%) and scalability (less than 100MB traffic for a full OS update, and estimated at a cent per device), making the current prototype specifically suitable for the AI-Edge (Artificial Intelligence on the Edge) IoT devices.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3427228.3427293,3,,,,,,,Kuniyasu Suzaki and Akira Tsukamoto and Andy Green and Mohammad Mannan,10.1145/3427228.3427293,,,,"Life Cycle Management,Public Key Infrastructure (PKI),Reboot-Oriented IoT,Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)",,,428-441,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3427228.3427293,2020,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2037,inproceedings,QUENN: QUantization engine for low-power neural networks,"Deep Learning is moving to edge devices, ushering in a new age of distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI). The high demand of computational resources required by deep neural networks may be alleviated by approximate computing techniques, and most notably reduced-precision arithmetic with coarsely quantized numerical representations. In this context, Bonseyes comes in as an initiative to enable stakeholders to bring AI to low-power and autonomous environments such as: Automotive, Medical Healthcare and Consumer Electronics. To achieve this, we introduce LPDNN, a framework for optimized deployment of Deep Neural Networks on heterogeneous embedded devices. In this work, we detail the quantization engine that is integrated in LPDNN. The engine depends on a fine-grained workflow which enables a Neural Network Design Exploration and a sensitivity analysis of each layer for quantization. We demonstrate the engine with a case study on Alexnet and VGG16 for three different techniques for direct quantization: standard fixed-point, dynamic fixed-point and k-means clustering, and demonstrate the potential of the latter. We argue that using a Gaussian quantizer with k-means clustering can achieve better performance than linear quantizers.

ID-2038,article,Data Subjects' Conceptualizations of and Attitudes Toward Automatic Emotion Recognition-Enabled Wellbeing Interventions on Social Media,"Automatic emotion recognition (ER)-enabled wellbeing interventions use ER algorithms to infer the emotions of a data subject (i.e., a person about whom data is collected or processed to enable ER) based on data generated from their online interactions, such as social media activity, and intervene accordingly. The potential commercial applications of this technology are widely acknowledged, particularly in the context of social media. Yet, little is known about data subjects' conceptualizations of and attitudes toward automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions. To address this gap, we interviewed 13 US adult social media data subjects regarding social media-based automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions. We found that participants' attitudes toward automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions were predominantly negative. Negative attitudes were largely shaped by how participants compared their conceptualizations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the humans that traditionally deliver wellbeing support. Comparisons between AI and human wellbeing interventions were based upon human attributes participants doubted AI could hold: 1) helpfulness and authentic care; 2) personal and professional expertise; 3) morality; and 4) benevolence through shared humanity. In some cases, participants' attitudes toward automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions shifted when participants conceptualized automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions' impact on others, rather than themselves. Though with reluctance, a minority of participants held more positive attitudes toward their conceptualizations of automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions, citing their potential to benefit others: 1) by supporting academic research; 2) by increasing access to wellbeing support; and 3) through egregious harm prevention. However, most participants anticipated harms associated with their conceptualizations of automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions for others, such as re-traumatization, the spread of inaccurate health information, inappropriate surveillance, and interventions informed by inaccurate predictions. Lastly, while participants had qualms about automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions, we identified three development and delivery qualities of automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions upon which their attitudes toward them depended: 1) accuracy; 2) contextual sensitivity; and 3) positive outcome. Our study is not motivated to make normative statements about whether or how automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions should exist, but to center voices of the data subjects affected by this technology. We argue for the inclusion of data subjects in the development of requirements for ethical and trustworthy ER applications. To that end, we discuss ethical, social, and policy implications of our findings, suggesting that automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions imagined by participants are incompatible with aims to promote trustworthy, socially aware, and responsible AI technologies in the current practical and regulatory landscape in the US.",https://dl-acm-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3476049,1,2,2,emotion recognition,,,"In interviews, Ps talked about four attributes that would be difficult for AI emotion recognition to emulate: 1) helpfulness and authentic care; 2) personal and professional expertise; 3) morality; and 4) benevolence through shared humanity",Kat Roemmich and Nazanin Andalibi,10.1145/3476049,,CSCW2,Proc.

It is also about which roles an AI could/should play from the radiologists' point of view and which tasks they can imagine for an AI. The qualitative study is based on semi-structured interviews with five radiologists and shows a differentiated picture of the roles of the AI in the diagnostic process: starting with the AI as the first or second examiner, over to the collaboration partner or the AI as the sole examiner in emergency situations. In addition, application areas beyond the diagnostic process were mentioned across the entire metaprocess of a radiology practice, from administrative to interactive functions. From the results of the study, three mutually dependent and interdependent projections for system design can be derived. First, an (1) adaptive, interactive system with a focus on the diagnostic process is recommended, as well as the development of a (2) service ecosystem beyond the diagnostic process and the (3) consideration of all user groups involved.

With nearly 30 million contestants in 63 provinces and cities across the country, the competition has created the joy of learning for tens of millions of students over the past 10 years. Following the success of Violympic, FPT corporation brought the VioEdu Online Education System to the market, contributing to creating fair learning opportunities for students nationwide, promoting the quality of national education. VioEdu is an online training system for elementary, junior high and high school students, helping to personalize their learning, save time and increase learning efficiency by applying the latest technology such as: Artificial intelligence (AI), Big data analysis, graphical knowledge modeling and compatible learning methods. Accordingly, the training process, data on learning behaviors and knowledge of students will be synthesized and analyzed by AI to find strengths and gaps in knowledge to propose appropriate learning pathways. As a result, each skill, depending on the nature, will be cultivated or promoted separately, helping them to learn the right focus and not spread out. The content of the lessons on VioEdu is developed and developed by a team of excellent teachers and educational experts from education departments and universities, following the curriculum of Vietnamese textbooks. In addition, the system also has about 30% of advanced and expanded knowledge. The form of visual lecture presentation, built as a game with encouraging prizes, creates a learning interest for children. Only with computers or mobile devices connected to the internet, students from all over the country can access modern education, shorten the knowledge gap between regions by the VioEdu online education system. Currently, the system has more than 400 video lectures and more than 100,000 content of Math teaching knowledge for elementary students.

ID-2041,inproceedings,PT-spike: a precise-time-dependent single spike neuromorphic architecture with efficient supervised learning,"One of the most exciting advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the last decade is the wide adoption of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), such as Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in real world applications. However, the underlying massive amounts of computation and storage requirement greatly challenge their applicability in resource-limited platforms like drone, mobile phone and IoT devices etc. The third generation of neural network model-Spiking Neural Network (SNN), inspired by the working mechanism and efficiency of human brain, has emerged as a promising solution for achieving more impressive computing and power efficiency within light-weighted devices (e.g. single chip). However, the relevant research activities have been narrowly carried out on conventional rate-based spiking system designs for fulfilling the practical cognitive tasks, underestimating SNN's energy efficiency, throughput and system flexibility. Although the time-based SNN can be more attractive conceptually, its potentials are not unleashed in realistic applications due to lack of efficient coding and practical learning schemes. In this work, a Precise-Time-Dependent Single Spike Neuromorphic Architecture, namely ""PT-Spike"", is developed to bridge this gap. Three constituent hardware-favorable techniques: precise single-spike temporal encoding, efficient supervised temporal learning and fast asymmetric decoding are proposed accordingly to boost the energy efficiency and data processing capability of the time-based SNN at a more compact neural network model size when executing real cognitive tasks. Simulation results show that ""PT-Spike"" demonstrates significant improvements in network size, processing efficiency and power consumption with marginal classification accuracy degradation, when compared with the rate-based SNN and ANN under the similar network configuration.",,3,,,,,,attributes included: 1) helpfulness and authentic care; 2); personal and professional expertise; 3),Tao Liu and Lei Jiang and Yier Jin and Gang Quan and Wujie Wen,,,,,,,,568-573,,IEEE Press,,,2018,,

However, in both industry and academia little research has been carried out on the relationship between virtual camera, game-play and player behaviour.

The proposed WAF, which is called (HiWAF), is a web application firewall that works in three modes: positive, negative and session based security modes. The new approach that distinguishes this WAF among other WAFs is that it utilizes the concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) instead of regular expressions or other traditional pattern matching techniques as its filtering engine.

While some factors like uniqueness and humor can only be measured by human subjects, in a strategical game, the rule system is an important and measurable factor. Classics like chess and GO have a millennia-old story of success, based on clever rule design. They only have a few rules, are relatively easy to understand, but still they have myriads of possibilities. Testing the deepness of a rule-set is very hard, especially for a rule system as complex as in a classic strategic computer game. It is necessary, though, to ensure prolonged gaming fun.In our approach, we use artificial intelligence (AI) to simulate hours of beta-testing the given rules, tweaking the rules to provide more game-playing fun and deepness. To avoid making the AI a mirror of its programmer's gaming preferences, we not only evolved the AI with a genetic algorithm, but also used three fundamentally different AI paradigms to find boring loopholes, inefficient game mechanisms and, last but not least, complex erroneous behavior.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/1401843.1401845,3,,,,,,,Christoph Salge and Christian Lipski and Tobias Mahlmann and Brigitte Mathiak,10.1145/1401843.1401845,,,,"fun,genetic algorithm,strategic games",,,7-14,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/1401843.1401845,2008,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-2046,inproceedings,Addressing challenges in promoting healthy lifestyles: the al-chatbot approach,"Healthy lifestyles promotion is the main objective of primary care interventions, starting from the pediatric age, were overweight is nowadays exposing about one third of children to the risk of developing chronic diseases, such as diabetes. Recent years have seen a blast of mHealth apps for health promotion, targeting in particular nutrition and dietary behaviour change. However, reviews show difficulties in the adoption and effective usage of these applications in telemedicine and by the population in general, due to a lack of evidence-based content and strategies provided (e.g., by commercial apps) or lack of sufficient user engagement with the apps. Nutrition apps typically require self-reporting of food intake by the user which is often seen as a burden and a cause of abandonment of the app. However, current wave of research has taken up the challenge of promoting healthy lifestyles with advances in artificial intelligence (AI). This paper focus on AI chatbots as an innovative approach offering more simplicity and facilitating long-term adherence to health promotion interventions. Conversational assistants provide the advantage of being deployed in smartphones and laptops within a wide variety of applications. We will particularly focus on harnessing the power of intelligent chatbot systems to provide behaviour change interventions in telemedicine for healthy lifestyle promotion. We describe an application scenario for an AI-chatbot delivering support to nutrition education that could help to overcome current limitations of similar mHealth solutions provided for healthy lifestyles and contribute to more effective public health interventions in this application domain.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3154862.3154914,3,,,,,,,Ahmed Fadhil and Silvia Gabrielli,10.1145/3154862.3154914,,,,"behaviour change interventions,chatbots,health promotion,nutrition education,sustainability",,,261-265,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3154862.3154914,2017,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2047,inproceedings,The Cost of Ethical AI Development for AI Startups,"Artificial Intelligence startups use training data as direct inputs in product development. These firms must balance numerous tradeoffs between ethical issues and data access without substantive guidance from regulators or existing judicial precedence. We survey these startups to determine what actions they have taken to address these ethical issues and the consequences of those actions. We find that 58% of these startups have established a set of AI principles. Startups with data-sharing relationships with high-technology firms or that have prior experience with privacy regulations are more likely to establish ethical AI principles and are more likely to take costly steps, like dropping training data or turning down business, to adhere to their ethical AI policies. Moreover, startups with ethical AI policies are more likely to invest in unconscious bias training, hire ethnic minorities and female programmers, seek expert advice, and search for more diverse training data. Potential costs associated with data-sharing relationships and the adherence to ethical policies may create tradeoffs between increased AI product competition and more ethical AI production.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3514094.3534195,3,,,,,,,James Bessen and Stephen Michael Impink and Robert Seamans,10.1145/3514094.3534195,,,,"AI,data,ethics,scale barriers,startups",,,92-106,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3514094.3534195,2022,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-2049,inproceedings,CapAlign: Improving Cross Modal Alignment via Informative Captioning for Harmful Meme Detection,"Harmful memes detection is challenging due to the semantic gap between different modalities. Previous studies mainly focus on feature extraction and fusion to learn discriminative information from memes. However, they ignore the misalignment of the modalities caused by the modality gap and suffer from data scarcity, resulting in insufficient learning of fusion-based models. Recently, researchers transformed images into textual captions and used language models for predictions, resulting in non-informative image captions. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an instructions-based abstracting approach CapAlign, in zero-shot visual question-answering settings. Precisely, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to ask informative questions to a pre-trained vision-language model and use the dialogues to generate a high-quality image caption. Further, to align the generated caption with the textual content of a meme, we used an LLM with instructions to generate informative captions of the meme and then prepend it with the attributes of the visual content of a meme to a prompt-based LM for prediction. Experimental findings on two benchmark datasets show that our approach produces informative captions and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for detecting harmful memes.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3589334.3648146,3,,,,,,,Junhui Ji and Xuanrui Lin and Usman Naseem,10.1145/3589334.3648146,,,,"captions,cross modal alignment,harmful",,,4585-4594,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3589334.3648146,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2050,inproceedings,The Looming Threat of Fake and LLM-generated LinkedIn Profiles: Challenges and Opportunities for Detection and Prevention,"In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting fake and Large Language Model (LLM)-generated profiles in the LinkedIn Online Social Network immediately upon registration and before establishing connections. Early fake profile identification is crucial to maintaining the platform's integrity since it prevents imposters from acquiring the private and sensitive information of legitimate users and from gaining an opportunity to increase their credibility for future phishing and scamming activities. This work uses textual information provided in LinkedIn profiles and introduces the Section and Subsection Tag Embedding (SSTE) method to enhance the discriminative characteristics of these data for distinguishing between legitimate profiles and those created by imposters manually or by using an LLM. Additionally, the dearth of a large publicly available LinkedIn dataset motivated us to collect 3600 LinkedIn profiles for our research. We release our dataset publicly for research purposes. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large publicly available LinkedIn dataset for fake LinkedIn account detection. Within our paradigm, we assess static and contextualized word embeddings, including GloVe, Flair, BERT, and RoBERTa. We show that the suggested method can distinguish between legitimate and fake profiles with an accuracy of about 95% across all word embeddings. In addition, we show that SSTE has a promising accuracy for identifying LLM-generated profiles, despite the fact that no LLM-generated profiles were employed during the training phase, and can achieve an accuracy of approximately 90% when only 20 LLM-generated profiles are added to the training set. It is a significant finding since the proliferation of several LLMs in the near future makes it extremely challenging to design a single system that can identify profiles created with various LLMs.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3603163.3609064,3,,,,,,,Navid Ayoobi and Sadat Shahriar and Arjun Mukherjee,10.1145/3603163.3609064,,,,"ChatGPT,Fake accounts,Large language models,LinkedIn,LinkedIn dataset",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3603163.3609064,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2051,inproceedings,Automated Generation and Tagging of Knowledge Components from Multiple-Choice Questions,"Knowledge Components (KCs) linked to assessments enhance the measurement of student learning, enrich analytics, and facilitate adaptivity. However, generating and linking KCs to assessment items requires significant effort and domain-specific knowledge. To streamline this process for higher-education courses, we employed GPT-4 to generate KCs for multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Chemistry and E-Learning. We analyzed discrepancies between the KCs generated by the Large Language Model (LLM) and those made by humans through evaluation from three domain experts in each subject area. This evaluation aimed to determine whether, in instances of non-matching KCs, evaluators showed a preference for the LLM-generated KCs over their human-created counterparts. We also developed an ontology induction algorithm to cluster questions that assess similar KCs based on their content. Our most effective LLM strategy accurately matched KCs for 56% of Chemistry and 35% of E-Learning MCQs, with even higher success when considering the top five KC suggestions. Human evaluators favored LLM-generated KCs, choosing them over human-assigned ones approximately two-thirds of the time, a preference that was statistically significant across both domains. Our clustering algorithm successfully grouped questions by their underlying KCs without needing explicit labels or contextual information.

ID-2052,inproceedings,PREDILECT: Preferences Delineated with Zero-Shot Language-based Reasoning in Reinforcement Learning,"Preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a new field in robot learning, where humans play a pivotal role in shaping robot behavior by expressing preferences on different sequences of state-action pairs. However, formulating realistic policies for robots demands responses from humans to an extensive array of queries. In this work, we approach the sample-efficiency challenge by expanding the information collected per query to contain both preferences and optional text prompting. To accomplish this, we leverage the zero-shot capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to reason from the text provided by humans. To accommodate the additional query information, we reformulate the reward learning objectives to contain flexible highlights – state-action pairs that contain relatively high information and are related to the features processed in a zero-shot fashion from a pretrained LLM. In both a simulated scenario and a user study, we reveal the effectiveness of our work by analyzing the feedback and its implications.

The attribute-opinion pairs, expressed by users in their reviews for items, provide the potentials to capture user preferences and item characteristics at a fine-grained level. To this end, we propose a novel framework FineRec that explores the attribute-opinion pairs of reviews to finely handle sequential recommendation. Specifically, we utilize a large language model to extract attribute-opinion pairs from reviews. For each attribute, a unique attribute-specific user-opinion-item graph is created, where corresponding opinions serve as the edges linking heterogeneous user and item nodes. Afterwards, we devise a diversity-aware convolution operation to aggregate information within the graphs, enabling attribute-specific user and item representation learning. Ultimately, we present an interaction-driven fusion mechanism to integrate attribute-specific user/item representations across all attributes for generating recommendations. Extensive experiments conducted on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our FineRec over existing state-ofthe-art methods.

In this paper, we present and evaluate the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) to come up with high-quality explanations to further improve the support of users for three different recommendation approaches, including feature-based recommendation, collaborative filtering, and knowledge-based recommendation. We explain how an LLM can be applied to generate personalized explanations and evaluate the explanation goals in an online user study.

ID-2058,inproceedings,Generative News Recommendation,"Most existing news recommendation methods tackle this task by conducting semantic matching between candidate news and user representation produced by historical clicked news. However, they overlook the high-level connections among different news articles and also ignore the profound relationship between these news articles and users. And the definition of these methods dictates that they can only deliver news articles as-is. On the contrary, integrating several relevant news articles into a coherent narrative would assist users in gaining a quicker and more comprehensive understanding of events. In this paper, we propose a novel generative news recommendation paradigm that includes two steps: (1) Leveraging the internal knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the Large Language Model (LLM) to perform high-level matching between candidate news and user representation; (2) Generating a coherent and logically structured narrative based on the associations between related news and user interests, thus engaging users in further reading of the news. Specifically, we propose GNR to implement the generative news recommendation paradigm. First, we compose the dual-level representation of news and users by leveraging LLM to generate theme-level representations and combine them with semantic-level representations. Next, in order to generate a coherent narrative, we explore the news relation and filter the related news according to the user preference. Finally, we propose a novel training method named UIFT to train the LLM to fuse multiple news articles in a coherent narrative.

Existing models, however, struggle with the heterogeneous nature of contextual data and the user cold start problem. This study introduces a novel prediction model, Mobile App Prediction Leveraging Large Language Model Embeddings (MAPLE), which employs Large Language Models (LLMs) and installed app similarity to overcome these challenges. MAPLE utilises the power of LLMs to process contextual data and discern intricate relationships within it effectively. Additionally, we explore the use of installed app similarity to address the cold start problem, facilitating the modelling of user preferences and habits, even for new users with limited historical data. In essence, our research presents MAPLE as a novel, potent, and practical approach to app usage prediction, making significant strides in resolving issues faced by existing models. MAPLE stands out as a comprehensive and effective solution, setting a new benchmark for more precise and personalised app usage predictions. In tests on two real-world datasets, MAPLE surpasses contemporary models in both standard and cold start scenarios. These outcomes validate MAPLE's capacity for precise app usage predictions and its resilience against the cold start problem. This enhanced performance stems from the model's proficiency in capturing complex temporal patterns and leveraging contextual information.

To start addressing this gap, we investigated: RQ1: What are secondary educators' views on the potential classroom use of LLM program error message explanations? RQ2: In what ways can a feedback literacy perspective support the analysis of educators' views of potential classroom use of LLM program error message explanations? The responses of eight expert secondary school educators were gathered during a semi-structured, activity-based interview and qualitatively analysed. Fifteen themes were derived from their commentary, of which ten corresponded to enhanced program error message (PEM) guidelines. Yet, all themes correlated to feedback literacy theory, providing a more holistic view. The analysis revealed that educators preferred LLM explanations to guide and develop understanding rather than tell, that students should be supported to make judgements and action LLM-generated feedback. Combining PEM guideline and feedback literacy findings, we suggest augmented IDEs should be designed with educators and students in mind, and teacher professional development (PD) is needed.

CodeTailor provides a personalized Parsons puzzle to support struggling students. In a Parsons puzzle, students place mixed-up code blocks in the correct order to solve a problem. A technical evaluation with previous incorrect student code snippets demonstrated that CodeTailor could deliver high-quality (correct, personalized, and concise) Parsons puzzles based on their incorrect code. We conducted a within-subjects study with 18 novice programmers. Participants perceived CodeTailor as more engaging than just receiving an LLM-generated solution (the baseline condition). In addition, participants applied more supported elements from the scaffolded practice to the posttest when using CodeTailor than baseline. Overall, most participants preferred using CodeTailor versus just receiving the LLM-generated code for learning.

We investigate the persuasive quality of AI-generated messages to understand how AI could impact public health messaging. Specifically, through a series of studies designed to characterize and evaluate generative AI in developing public health messages, we analyze COVID-19 pro-vaccination messages generated by GPT-3, a state-of-the-art instantiation of a large language model. Study 1 is a systematic evaluation of GPT-3's ability to generate pro-vaccination messages. Study 2 then observed peoples' perceptions of curated GPT-3-generated messages compared to human-authored messages released by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), finding that GPT-3 messages were perceived as more effective, stronger arguments, and evoked more positive attitudes than CDC messages. Finally, Study 3 assessed the role of source labels on perceived quality, finding that while participants preferred AI-generated messages, they expressed dispreference for messages that were labeled as AI-generated. The results suggest that, with human supervision, AI can be used to create effective public health messages, but that individuals prefer their public health messages to come from human institutions rather than AI sources.

In this paper, we propose a zero-shot VQA model named Zero-shot VQA for Flood Disaster Damage Assessment (ZFDDA). It is a VQA model for damage assessment without pre-training. Also, with flood disaster as the main research object, we build a Freestyle Flood Disaster Image Question Answering dataset (FFD-IQA) to evaluate our VQA model. This new dataset expands the question types to include free-form, multiple-choice, and yes-no questions. At the same time, we expand the size of the previous dataset to contain a total of 2,058 images and 22,422 question-meta ground truth pairs. Most importantly, our model uses well-designed chain of thought (CoT) demonstrations to unlock the potential of the large language model, allowing zero-shot VQA to show better performance in disaster scenarios. The experimental results show that the accuracy in answering complex questions is greatly improved with CoT prompts. Our study provides a research basis for subsequent research of VQA for other disaster scenarios.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3652628.3652689,3,,,,,,,Yimin Sun and Chao Wang and Yan Peng,10.1145/3652628.3652689,,,,,,,368-373,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3652628.3652689,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2064,inproceedings,Grading Programming Assignments by Summarization,"Grading programming assignments manually is a big burden for instructors who teach programming languages for university students due to complexity and subjectivity. The black test approach adopted by online judge systems can only outputs either an answer is correct or incorrect. This study proposes a Large Language Model (LLM) approach to automatically grade answers from students for programming assignments. A LLM mode formed by coder-decoder architecture is utilized to generate summarization from source code, then the summarization is compared to the textual assignment description by semantic similarity. Finally, the output is converted to five-score rating. CodeBERT and a Transformer model serve as coder and decoder respectively. The semantic similarity is computed by MiniLM-L6. The validation test shows that the accuracy of the suggested approach reaches 0.92.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3674399.3674426,3,,,,,,,Dong Dong and Yue Liang,10.1145/3674399.3674426,,,,"CodeBERT,automatic grading,programming assignment assessment,source code summarization",,,53-58,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3674399.3674426,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-2066,inproceedings,One-step Reach: LLM-based Keyword Generation for Sponsored Search Advertising,"Query keyword matching plays a crucial role in sponsored search advertising by retrieving semantically related keywords of the user query to target relevant advertisements. Conventional technical solutions adopt the retrieve-judge-then-rank retrieval framework structured in cascade funnels. However, it has limitations in accurately depicting the semantic relevance between the query and keyword, and the cumulative funnel losses result in unsatisfactory precision and recall. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based keyword generation method (LKG) to reach related keywords from the search query in one step. LKG models the query keyword matching as an end-to-end keyword generation task based on the LLM through multi-match prompt tuning. Moreover, it employs the feedback tuning and the prefix tree-based constrained beam search to improve the generation quality and efficiency.

Although sentiment analysis and emotion classification have garnered attention, research on mood classification remains in its early stages. This study adopts a two-dimensional structure of affect, comprising ”pleasantness” and ”activation,” to classify mood patterns. Emojis, graphic symbols representing emotions and concepts, are widely used in computer-mediated communication. Unlike previous studies that consider emojis as direct labels for emotion or sentiment, this work uses a pre-trained large language model which integrates both text and emojis to develop a mood classification model. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we annotate 10,000 Thai tweets with mood to train the models and release the dataset to the public. Second, we show that emojis contribute to determining mood to a lesser extent than text, far from mapping directly to mood. Third, through the application of the trained model, we observe the correlation of moods during the Thai political turmoil of 2019-2020 on Thai Twitter and find a significant correlation.

ID-2070,inproceedings,DynaPipe: Optimizing Multi-task Training through Dynamic Pipelines,"Multi-task model training has been adopted to enable a single deep neural network model (often a large language model) to handle multiple tasks (e.g., question answering and text summarization). Multi-task training commonly receives input sequences of highly different lengths due to the diverse contexts of different tasks. Padding (to the same sequence length) or packing (short examples into long sequences of the same length) is usually adopted to prepare input samples for model training, which is nonetheless not space or computation efficient. This paper proposes a dynamic micro-batching approach to tackle sequence length variation and enable efficient multi-task model training. We advocate pipelineparallel training of the large model with variable-length micro-batches, each of which potentially comprises a different number of samples. We optimize micro-batch construction using a dynamic programming-based approach, and handle micro-batch execution time variation through dynamic pipeline and communication scheduling, enabling highly efficient pipeline training. Extensive evaluation on the FLANv2 dataset demonstrates up to 4.39x higher training throughput when training T5, and 3.25x when training GPT, as compared with packing-based baselines.

ID-2072,inproceedings,Human and Large Language Model Intent Detection in Image-Based Self-Expression of People with Intellectual Disability,"Non-verbal communication is essential for the social inclusion of individuals with an intellectual disability, affecting interactions with others as well as technological systems. This study focuses on non-symbolic communication of people with intellectual disability through generic images without specific or detailed subject matter. A key challenge in this medium is discerning the underlying intentions behind images selected as visual prompts for conversation. Through interviews with people with intellectual disability, we collected a dataset of images and their associated communication intentions, as well as the interpreted intention from potential audiences including humans and systems. Notably, we employed GPT-4, a Large Language Model (LLM), to decipher the images and provide insights from the Conversational Systems’ (CSs) perspective. Adopting a user-centered qualitative approach, we analyzed this data to understand the nuances of image-based self-expression and identify areas of ambiguity. Additionally, we present an analysis of comprehension levels and challenges for intent detection faced by humans and systems. Our findings suggest that generic images offer a rich medium for individuals to share personal interests and unique experiences, enriching communication. Within this framework, we identified that situational, personal, and historical contexts facilitate understanding intents. In a comparative analysis of human and systems viewpoints, we found that LLMs have encouraging capabilities for detecting various aspects of ambiguity in predicting user intentions. Based on this, we offer design strategies for intent clarification and crafting more inclusive multimodal conversational tools for individuals with intellectual disability. Findings can be extrapolated to enhance image-based information retrieval and recommendation systems.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3627508.3638347,3,,,,,,,Alieh Hajizadeh Saffar and Laurianne Sitbon and Maria Hoogstrate and Ahmed Abbas and Sirinthip Roomkham and Dimity Miller,10.1145/3627508.3638347,,,,"Human-Computer Interaction,Image-Based Communication,Intellectual Disability,Intent Detection,Large Language Models,Non-verbal Communication",,,199-208,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3627508.3638347,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2073,inproceedings,ReLLa: Retrieval-enhanced Large Language Models for Lifelong Sequential Behavior Comprehension in Recommendation,"With large language models (LLMs) achieving remarkable breakthroughs in NLP domains, LLM-enhanced recommender systems have received much attention and have been actively explored currently. In this paper, we focus on adapting and empowering a pure large language model for zero-shot and few-shot recommendation tasks. First and foremost, we identify and formulate the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem for LLMs in recommendation domains, i.e., LLMs fail to extract useful information from a textual context of long user behavior sequence, even if the length of context is far from reaching the context limitation of LLMs. To address such an issue and improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we propose a novel framework, namely Retrieval enhanced Large Language models (ReLLa) for recommendation tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot recommendation, we perform semantic user behavior retrieval (SUBR) to improve the data quality of testing samples, which greatly reduces the difficulty for LLMs to extract the essential knowledge from user behavior sequences. As for few-shot recommendation, we further design retrieval-enhanced instruction tuning (ReiT) by adopting SUBR as a data augmentation technique for training samples. Specifically, we develop a mixed training dataset consisting of both the original data samples and their retrieval-enhanced counterparts. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of ReLLa compared with existing baseline models, as well as its capability for lifelong sequential behavior comprehension. To be highlighted, with only less than 10% training samples, few-shot ReLLa can outperform traditional CTR models that are trained on the entire training set (e.g., DCNv2, DIN, SIM).",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3589334.3645467,3,,,,,,,Jianghao Lin and Rong Shan and Chenxu Zhu and Kounianhua Du and Bo Chen and Shigang Quan and Ruiming Tang and Yong Yu and Weinan Zhang,10.1145/3589334.3645467,,,,"large language models,recommender systems,user modeling",,,3497-3508,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3589334.3645467,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

The fine-tuning dataset is constructed by the combination of rule template and gpt-3.5 enhancement, which avoids the costly and time-consuming problem caused by manual construction. The fine-tuning method adopts LoRA high-efficiency fine-tuning to save computing resources; Then, F1 value is used as the evaluation index to compare the extraction effect of the model under different fine-tuning datasets. The results show that the model has a good extraction effect on the research questions and method terms when training the dataset constructed by the combination of rule template and gpt-3.5 enhancement. Finally, according to the extracted research question phrases, BTM(Biterm Topic Model) is used to study the distribution of topic words, and soft clustering of research question phrases is carried out according to the obtained topic words, so as to realize the correlation between the research results and professional terms, which provides the foundation for the future establishment of the knowledge graph and knowledge base of new energy power.CCS CONCEPTS • Theory of computation • Theory and algorithms for application domains • Unsupervised learning and clustering",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3638884.3638961,3,,,,,,,Wenjing Liu and Suxiang Zhang and Yang Sun and Xing Sheng and Zhidong Wu,10.1145/3638884.3638961,,,,"Biterm Topic Model,Chinese LLaMA Fine-Tuning,Soft clustering,Terminology extraction",,,484-491,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3638884.3638961,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2075,inproceedings,Alibaba HPN: A Data Center Network for Large Language Model Training,"This paper presents HPN, Alibaba Cloud's data center network for large language model (LLM) training. Due to the differences between LLMs and general cloud computing (e.g., in terms of traffic patterns and fault tolerance), traditional data center networks are not well-suited for LLM training. LLM training produces a small number of periodic, bursty flows (e.g., 400Gbps) on each host. This characteristic of LLM training predisposes Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) to hash polarization, causing issues such as uneven traffic distribution. HPN introduces a 2-tier, dual-plane architecture capable of interconnecting 15K GPUs within one Pod, typically accommodated by the traditional 3-tier Clos architecture. Such a new architecture design not only avoids hash polarization but also greatly reduces the search space for path selection. Another challenge in LLM training is that its requirement for GPUs to complete iterations in synchronization makes it more sensitive to singlepoint failure (typically occurring on ToR). HPN proposes a new dual-ToR design to replace the single-ToR in traditional data center networks. HPN has been deployed in our production for more than eight months.

ID-2078,inproceedings,Zero-shot Behavior Detection Based on Multimodal Large Language Model Expansion.,"Identifying and preventing unsafe behaviors is an important task to protect people’s lives and property. Due to the complexity of behavioral types and the fact that many behavioral actions have small amplitude, rendering ineffective spatial and temporal variation information, zero-shot image-based detection of unsafe behaviors is a highly challenging task. The multimodal large language model shows excellent performance in the zero-shot task once it appears. However, it is often impossible to accurately locate and analyze each individual’s behavior in complex scenes solely relying on its ability. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative zero-shot method to detect unsafe behaviors. We built a two-stage detection model. First, we focus on the target area of people through the target detection algorithm, and then analyze the behavior through the multimodal large language model combined with the construction strategy of positive and negative description prompts. This method shows excellent performance on the dataset we built. It can accurately identify unsafe behaviors in the real environment, which is very important to protect public safety and property.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3670105.3670147,3,,,,,,,Guangxin Wang and Xue Li and Dongshen Guo and Qiang Duan and Qibin Chen and Kai Jiang and Rui Li and Zizhong Wei,10.1145/3670105.3670147,,,,"Behavior Detection,Multimodal Large Language Model,Zero-shot",,,251-255,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3670105.3670147,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

Ideally these come from real searchers, but it is hard to collect this data at scale, so typical experiments rely on third-party labellers who may or may not produce accurate annotations. Label quality is managed with ongoing auditing, training, and monitoring. We discuss an alternative approach. We take careful feedback from real searchers and use this to select a large language model (LLM), and prompt, that agrees with this feedback; the LLM can then produce labels at scale. Our experiments show LLMs are as accurate as human labellers and as useful for finding the best systems and hardest queries. LLM performance varies with prompt features, but also varies unpredictably with simple paraphrases.

ID-2080,inproceedings,Seven Failure Points When Engineering a Retrieval Augmented Generation System,"Software engineers are increasingly adding semantic search capabilities to applications using a strategy known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). A RAG system involves finding documents that semantically match a query and then passing the documents to a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to extract the right answer using an LLM. RAG systems aim to: a) reduce the problem of hallucinated responses from LLMs, b) link sources/references to generated responses, and c) remove the need for annotating documents with meta-data. However, RAG systems suffer from limitations inherent to information retrieval systems and from reliance on LLMs. In this paper, we present an experience report on the failure points of RAG systems from three case studies from separate domains: research, education, and biomedical. We share the lessons learned and present 7 failure points to consider when designing a RAG system. The two key takeaways arising from our work are: 1) validation of a RAG system is only feasible during operation, and 2) the robustness of a RAG system evolves rather than designed in at the start.

Traditional RCA methods, which rely on manual investigations of data sources such as logs and traces, are often laborious, error-prone, and challenging for on-call engineers. In this paper, we introduce RCACopilot, an innovative on-call system empowered by the large language model for automating RCA of cloud incidents. RCACopilot matches incoming incidents to corresponding incident handlers based on their alert types, aggregates the critical runtime diagnostic information, predicts the incident's root cause category, and provides an explanatory narrative. We evaluate RCACopilot using a real-world dataset consisting of a year's worth of incidents from Microsoft. Our evaluation demonstrates that RCACopilot achieves RCA accuracy up to 0.766.

This work focuses on tackling the challenges of the crowd behavior generation problem. Existing approaches are labor-intensive, relying on practitioners to manually craft the complex behavior systems. We propose a machine learning approach to synthesize diversified dynamic crowd animation scenarios for a given environment based on a text description input. We first train two conditional diffusion models that generate text-guided agent distribution fields and velocity fields. Assisted by local navigation algorithms, the fields are then used to control multiple groups of agents. We further employ Large-Language Model (LLM) to canonicalize the general script into a structured sentence for more stable training and better scalability. To train our diffusion models, we devise a constructive method to generate random environments and crowd animations. We show that our trained diffusion models can generate crowd animations for both unseen environments and novel scenario descriptions. Our method paves the way towards automatic generating of crowd behaviors for virtual environments.

ID-2085,inproceedings,Predicting challenge moments from students' discourse: A comparison of GPT-4 to two traditional natural language processing approaches,"Effective collaboration requires groups to strategically regulate themselves to overcome challenges. Research has shown that groups may fail to regulate due to differences in members’ perceptions of challenges which may benefit from external support. In this study, we investigated the potential of leveraging three distinct natural language processing models: an expert knowledge rule-based model, a supervised machine learning (ML) model and a Large Language model (LLM), in challenge detection and challenge dimension identification (cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and technical/other challenges) from student discourse, was investigated. The results show that the supervised ML and the LLM approaches performed considerably well in both tasks, in contrast to the rule-based approach, whose efficacy heavily relies on the engineered features by experts. The paper provides an extensive discussion of the three approaches’ performance for automated detection and support of students’ challenge moments in collaborative learning activities. It argues that, although LLMs provide many advantages, they are unlikely to be the panacea to issues of the detection and feedback provision of socially shared regulation of learning due to their lack of reliability, as well as issues of validity evaluation, privacy and confabulation.

ID-2086,inproceedings,Sequential Recommendation with Latent Relations based on Large Language Model,"Sequential recommender systems predict items that may interest users by modeling their preferences based on historical interactions. Traditional sequential recommendation methods rely on capturing implicit collaborative filtering signals among items. Recent relation-aware sequential recommendation models have achieved promising performance by explicitly incorporating item relations into the modeling of user historical sequences, where most relations are extracted from knowledge graphs. However, existing methods rely on manually predefined relations and suffer the sparsity issue, limiting the generalization ability in diverse scenarios with varied item relations.In this paper, we propose a novel relation-aware sequential recommendation framework with Latent Lelation Riscovery (LRD). Different from previous relation-aware models that rely on predefined rules, we propose to leverage the Large Language Model (LLM) to provide new types of relations and connections between items. The motivation is that LLM contains abundant world knowledge, which can be adopted to mine latent relations of items for recommendation. Specifically, inspired by that humans can describe relations between items using natural language, LRD harnesses the LLM that has demonstrated human-like knowledge to obtain language knowledge representations of items. These representations are fed into a latent relation discovery module based on the discrete state variational autoencoder (DVAE). Then the self-supervised relation discovery tasks and recommendation tasks are jointly optimized. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate our proposed latent relation discovery method can be incorporated with existing relation-aware sequential recommendation models and significantly improve the performance. Further analysis experiments indicate the effectiveness and reliability of the discovered latent relations.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3626772.3657762,3,,,,,,,Shenghao Yang and Weizhi Ma and Peijie Sun and Qingyao Ai and Yiqun Liu and Mingchen Cai and Min Zhang,10.1145/3626772.3657762,,,,"large language model,latent relation,sequential recommendation",,,335-344,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3626772.3657762,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-2088,inproceedings,Leveraging LLMs for Unsupervised Dense Retriever Ranking,"In this paper we present Large Language Model Assisted Retrieval Model Ranking (LARMOR), an effective unsupervised approach that leverages LLMs for selecting which dense retriever to use on a test corpus (target). Dense retriever selection is crucial for many IR applications that rely on using dense retrievers trained on public corpora to encode or search a new, private target corpus. This is because when confronted with domain shift, where the downstream corpora, domains, or tasks of the target corpus differ from the domain/task the dense retriever was trained on, its performance often drops. Furthermore, when the target corpus is unlabeled, e.g., in a zero-shot scenario, the direct evaluation of the model on the target corpus becomes unfeasible. Unsupervised selection of the most effective pre-trained dense retriever becomes then a crucial challenge. Current methods for dense retriever selection are insufficient in handling scenarios with domain shift.Our proposed solution leverages LLMs to generate pseudo-relevant queries, labels and reference lists based on a set of documents sampled from the target corpus. Dense retrievers are then ranked based on their effectiveness on these generated pseudo-relevant signals. Notably, our method is the first approach that relies solely on the target corpus, eliminating the need for both training corpora and test labels. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we construct a large pool of state-of-the-art dense retrievers. The proposed approach outperforms existing baselines with respect to both dense retriever selection and ranking.

ID-2089,inproceedings,Enhancing Interactive Image Retrieval With Query Rewriting Using Large Language Models and Vision Language Models,"Image search stands as a pivotal task in multimedia and computer vision, finding applications across diverse domains, ranging from internet search to medical diagnostics. Conventional image search systems operate by accepting textual or visual queries, retrieving the top-relevant candidate results from the database. However, prevalent methods often rely on single-turn procedures, introducing potential inaccuracies and limited recall. These methods also face the challenges, such as vocabulary mismatch and the semantic gap, constraining their overall effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose an interactive image retrieval system capable of refining queries based on user relevance feedback in a multi-turn setting. This system incorporates a vision language model (VLM) based image captioner to enhance the quality of text-based queries, resulting in more informative queries with each iteration. Moreover, we introduce a large language model (LLM) based denoiser to refine text-based query expansions, mitigating inaccuracies in image descriptions generated by captioning models. To evaluate our system, we curate a new dataset by adapting the MSR-VTT video retrieval dataset to the image retrieval task, offering multiple relevant ground truth images for each query. Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed system against baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a notable 10% improvement in terms of recall.

ID-2090,inproceedings,TRAD: Enhancing LLM Agents with Step-Wise Thought Retrieval and Aligned Decision,"Several large language model (LLM) agents have been constructed for diverse purposes such as web navigation and online shopping, leveraging the broad knowledge and text comprehension capabilities of LLMs. Many of these works rely on in-context examples to achieve generalization without requiring fine-tuning. However, few have addressed the challenge of selecting and effectively utilizing these examples. Recent approaches have introduced trajectory-level retrieval with task meta-data and the use of trajectories as in-context examples to enhance overall performance in some sequential decision making tasks like computer control. Nevertheless, these methods face issues like plausible examples retrieved without task-specific state transition dynamics and long input with plenty of irrelevant context due to using complete trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (TRAD) to tackle these problems. TRAD first employs Thought Retrieval for step-level demonstration selection through thought matching, enhancing the quality of demonstrations and reducing irrelevant input noise. Then, Aligned Decision is introduced to complement retrieved demonstration steps with their preceding or subsequent steps, providing tolerance for imperfect thought and offering a balance between more context and less noise. Extensive experiments on ALFWorld and Mind2Web benchmarks demonstrate that TRAD not only surpasses state-of-the-art models but also effectively reduces noise and promotes generalization.

ID-2091,inproceedings,Search-in-the-Chain: Interactively Enhancing Large Language Models with Search for Knowledge-intensive Tasks,"Making the contents generated by Large Language Model (LLM), accurate, credible and traceable is crucial, especially in complex knowledge-intensive tasks that require multi-step reasoning and each step needs knowledge to solve. Retrieval-augmented generation is good potential to solve this problem. However, where and how to introduce Information Retrieval (IR) to LLM is a big challenge. Previous work has the problems that wrong knowledge retrieved by IR misleads the LLM and interaction between IR and LLM breaks the reasoning chain of LLM. This paper proposes a novel framework named Search-in-the-Chain (SearChain) for the interaction between LLM and IR to solve the challenges. First, LLM generates the reasoning chain named Chain-of-Query (CoQ) where each node consists of an IR-oriented query-answer pair. Second, IR verifies the answer of each node of CoQ. It corrects the answer that is not consistent with the retrieved information when IR gives high confidence, which improves the credibility. Third, LLM can indicate its missing knowledge in CoQ and rely on IR to provide this knowledge to LLM. These operations improve the accuracy in terms of reasoning and knowledge. Finally, SearChain generates the reasoning process and marks references to supporting documents for each reasoning step, which improves traceability. Interaction with IR in SearChain forms a novel reasoning path based on a tree, which enables LLM to dynamically modify the direction of reasoning. Experiments show that SearChain outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on complex knowledge-intensive tasks including multi-hop Q&amp;A, slot filling, fact checking, and long-form Q&amp;A.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3589334.3645363,3,,,,,,,Shicheng Xu and Liang Pang and Huawei Shen and Xueqi Cheng and Tat-Seng Chua,10.1145/3589334.3645363,,,,"large language models,retrieval-augmented model",,,1362-1373,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3589334.3645363,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

With this study, we provide interesting insights into the chatbots’ efficacy in financial advisement and their ability to provide fair treatment across different user groups. We find that both Bard and ChatGPT can make errors in retrieving basic online information, the responses they generate are inconsistent across different user groups, and they cannot be relied on for reasoning involving banking products. On the other hand, despite their limited generalization capabilities, rule-based chatbots like SafeFinance provide safe and reliable answers to users that can be traced back to their original source.

In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore TBPS without parallel image-text data (μ-TBPS), in which only non-parallel images and texts, or even image-only data, can be adopted. Towards this end, we propose a two-stage framework, generation-then-retrieval (GTR), to first generate the corresponding pseudo text for each image and then perform the retrieval in a supervised manner. In the generation stage, we propose a fine-grained image captioning strategy to obtain an enriched description of the person image, which firstly utilizes a set of instruction prompts to activate the off-the-shelf pretrained vision-language model to capture and generate fine-grained person attributes, and then converts the extracted attributes into a textual description via the finetuned large language model or the hand-crafted template. In the retrieval stage, considering the noise interference of the generated texts for training model, we develop a confidence score-based training scheme by enabling more reliable texts to contribute more during the training. Experimental results on multiple TBPS benchmarks (i.e., CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid) show that the proposed GTR can achieve a promising performance without relying on parallel image-text data.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3581783.3612285,3,,,,,,,Yang Bai and Jingyao Wang and Min Cao and Chen Chen and Ziqiang Cao and Liqiang Nie and Min Zhang,10.1145/3581783.3612285,,,,"confidence score,image captioning,non-parallel image-text data,text-based person search",,,757-767,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3581783.3612285,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2094,article,GPTuner: A Manual-Reading Database Tuning System via GPT-Guided Bayesian Optimization,"Modern database management systems (DBMS) expose hundreds of configurable knobs to control system behaviours. Determining the appropriate values for these knobs to improve DBMS performance is a long-standing problem in the database community. As there is an increasing number of knobs to tune and each knob could be in continuous or categorical values, manual tuning becomes impractical. Recently, automatic tuning systems using machine learning methods have shown great potentials. However, existing approaches still incur significant tuning costs or only yield sub-optimal performance. This is because they either ignore the extensive domain knowledge available (e.g., DBMS manuals and forum discussions) and only rely on the runtime feedback of benchmark evaluations to guide the optimization, or they utilize the domain knowledge in a limited way. Hence, we propose GPTuner, a manual-reading database tuning system that leverages domain knowledge extensively and automatically to optimize search space and enhance the runtime feedback-based optimization process. Firstly, we develop a Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline to collect and refine heterogeneous knowledge, and propose a prompt ensemble algorithm to unify a structured view of the refined knowledge. Secondly, using the structured knowledge, we (1) design a workload-aware and training-free knob selection strategy, (2) develop a search space optimization technique considering the value range of each knob, and (3) propose a Coarse-to-Fine Bayesian Optimization Framework to explore the optimized space. Finally, we evaluate GPTuner under different benchmarks (TPC-C and TPC-H), metrics (throughput and latency) as well as DBMS (PostgreSQL and MySQL). Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, GPTuner identifies better configurations in 16x less time on average.

ID-2095,inproceedings,Protecting Intellectual Property of Large Language Model-Based Code Generation APIs via Watermarks,"The rise of large language model-based code generation (LLCG) has enabled various commercial services and APIs. Training LLCG models is often expensive and time-consuming, and the training data are often large-scale and even inaccessible to the public. As a result, the risk of intellectual property (IP) theft over the LLCG models (e.g., via imitation attacks) has been a serious concern. In this paper, we propose the first watermark (WM) technique to protect LLCG APIs from remote imitation attacks. Our proposed technique is based on replacing tokens in an LLCG output with their ""synonyms"" available in the programming language. A WM is thus defined as the stealthily tweaked distribution among token synonyms in LLCG outputs. We design six WM schemes (instantiated into over 30 WM passes) which rely on conceptually distinct token synonyms available in programming languages. Moreover, to check the IP of a suspicious model (decide if it is stolen from our protected LLCG API), we propose a statistical tests-based procedure that can directly check a remote, suspicious LLCG API.We evaluate our WM technique on LLCG models fine-tuned from two popular large language models, CodeT5 and CodeBERT. The evaluation shows that our approach is effective in both WM injection and IP check. The inserted WMs do not undermine the usage of normal users (i.e., high fidelity) and incur negligible extra cost. Moreover, our injected WMs exhibit high stealthiness and robustness against powerful attackers; even if they know all WM schemes, they can hardly remove WMs without largely undermining the accuracy of their stolen models.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3576915.3623120,3,,,,,,,Zongjie Li and Chaozheng Wang and Shuai Wang and Cuiyun Gao,10.1145/3576915.3623120,,,,"code generation,large language model,watermark",,,2336-2350,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3576915.3623120,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2096,inproceedings,An Empirical Study on How Large Language Models Impact Software Testing Learning,"Software testing is a challenging topic in software engineering education and requires creative approaches to engage learners. For example, the Code Defenders game has students compete over a Java class under test by writing effective tests and mutants. While such gamified approaches deal with problems of motivation and engagement, students may nevertheless require help to put testing concepts into practice. The recent widespread diffusion of Generative AI and Large Language Models raises the question of whether and how these disruptive technologies could address this problem, for example, by providing explanations of unclear topics and guidance for writing tests. However, such technologies might also be misused or produce inaccurate answers, which would negatively impact learning. To shed more light on this situation, we conducted the first empirical study investigating how students learn and practice new software testing concepts in the context of the Code Defenders testing game, supported by a smart assistant based on a widely known, commercial Large Language Model. Our study shows that students had unrealistic expectations about the smart assistant, “blindly” trusting any output it generated, and often trying to use it to obtain solutions for testing exercises directly. Consequently, students who resorted to the smart assistant more often were less effective and efficient than those who did not. For instance, they wrote 8.6% fewer tests, and their tests were not useful in 78.0% of the cases. We conclude that giving unrestricted and unguided access to Large Language Models might generally impair learning.

ID-2098,inproceedings,Why and When LLM-Based Assistants Can Go Wrong: Investigating the Effectiveness of Prompt-Based Interactions for Software Help-Seeking,"Large Language Model (LLM) assistants, such as ChatGPT, have emerged as potential alternatives to search methods for helping users navigate complex, feature-rich software. LLMs use vast training data from domain-specific texts, software manuals, and code repositories to mimic human-like interactions, offering tailored assistance, including step-by-step instructions. In this work, we investigated LLM-generated software guidance through a within-subject experiment with 16 participants and follow-up interviews. We compared a baseline LLM assistant with an LLM optimized for particular software contexts, SoftAIBot, which also offered guidelines for constructing appropriate prompts. We assessed task completion, perceived accuracy, relevance, and trust. Surprisingly, although SoftAIBot outperformed the baseline LLM, our results revealed no significant difference in LLM usage and user perceptions with or without prompt guidelines and the integration of domain context. Most users struggled to understand how the prompt’s text related to the LLM’s responses and often followed the LLM’s suggestions verbatim, even if they were incorrect. This resulted in difficulties when using the LLM’s advice for software tasks, leading to low task completion rates. Our detailed analysis also revealed that users remained unaware of inaccuracies in the LLM’s responses, indicating a gap between their lack of software expertise and their ability to evaluate the LLM’s assistance. With the growing push for designing domain-specific LLM assistants, we emphasize the importance of incorporating explainable, context-aware cues into LLMs to help users understand prompt-based interactions, identify biases, and maximize the utility of LLM assistants.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3640543.3645200,3,,,,,,,Anjali Khurana and Hariharan Subramonyam and Parmit K Chilana,10.1145/3640543.3645200,,,,"feature-rich software,help-seeking,large language models,prompt-based interactions",,,288-303,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3640543.3645200,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2099,inproceedings,Improving Conversational User Interfaces for Citizen Complaint Management through enhanced Contextual Feedback,"As cities transform, disrupting citizens’ lives, their participation in urban development is often undervalued despite its importance. Citizen complaint systems exist but are often limited in fostering meaningful dialogue with municipalities. Meanwhile, smart cities aim to improve living standards, efficiency, and sustainability by integrating digital twins with physical infrastructures, potentially enhancing transparency and enriching communication between cities and their inhabitants with real-time data. Complementing these developments, technologies realizing Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) are becoming more capable in providing a conversational and feedback-oriented approach such as complaint management processes. The improvement of CUIs for citizen complaint management through enhanced contextual feedback is explored in this work. The term contextual feedback has been developed and defined as all information (for example, background, conditions, explanations, timelines, and the existence of similar complaints) related to a complaint and or the underlying problem that could potentially be relevant for the user. The solution proposed in this paper gathers data from users about their issues via a CUI, which subsequently queries various data sources to obtain relevant contextual information. Following this, a Large Language Model processes the collected data to produce the corresponding feedback. In the study, a static CUI without contextual data as the baseline has been compared to a CUI that includes contextual data, analyzing their impact on pragmatic and hedonic quality, reuse intention, and potential influence on the citizens’ trust in their municipality. The study has been conducted in cooperation with the German municipality of Wadgassen. The good performance of the baseline system shows the general potential of LLMs in the citizen complaint domain even without data sources. The results show that contextual feedback performed better overall, with significant improvements in the pragmatic and hedonic quality, attractiveness, reuse intention, feeling that the complaint is taken seriously, and the citizens’ trust in their municipality.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3640794.3665562,3,,,,,,,Kai Karren and Michael Schmitz and Stefan Schaffer,10.1145/3640794.3665562,,,,"Citizen Engagement,Context Information,Conversational UI,Smart City",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3640794.3665562,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-2101,article,Automated Disentangled Sequential Recommendation with Large Language Models,"Sequential recommendation aims to recommend the next items that a target user may have interest in based on the user’s sequence of past behaviors, which has become a hot research topic in both academia and industry. In the literature, sequential recommendation adopts a Sequence-to-Item or Sequence-to-Sequence training strategy, which supervises a sequential model with a user’s next one or more behaviors as the labels and the sequence of the past behaviors as the input. However, existing powerful sequential recommendation approaches employ more and more complex deep structures such as Transformer in order to accurately capture the sequential patterns, which heavily rely on hand-crafted designs on key attention mechanism to achieve state-of-the-art performance, thus failing to automatically obtain the optimal design of attention representation architectures in various scenarios with different data. Other works on classic automated deep recommender systems only focus on traditional settings, ignoring the problem of sequential scenarios. In this paper, we study the problem of automated sequential recommendation, which faces two main challenges: i) How can we design a proper search space tailored for attention automation in sequential recommendation, and ii) How can we accurately search effective attention representation architectures considering multiple user interests reflected in the sequential behavior. To tackle these challenges, we propose an automated disentangled sequential recommendation (AutoDisenSeq) model. In particular, we employ neural architecture search (NAS) and design a search space tailored for automated attention representation in attentive intention-disentangled sequential recommendation with an expressive and efficient space complexity of  (O(n^2))  given  (n)  as the number of layers. We further propose a context-aware parameter sharing mechanism taking characteristics of each sub-architecture into account to enable accurate architecture performance estimations and great flexibility for disentanglement of latent intention representation. Moreover, we propose AutoDisenSeq-LLM, which utilizes the textual understanding power of large language model (LLM) as a guidance to refine the candidate list for recommendation from AutoDisenSeq. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our proposed AutoDisenSeq model and AutoDisenSeq-LLM model outperform existing baseline methods on four real-world datasets in both overall recommendation and cold-start recommendation scenarios.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3675164,3,,,,,,,Xin Wang and Hong Chen and Zirui Pan and Yuwei Zhou and Chaoyu Guan and Lifeng Sun and Wenwu Zhu,10.1145/3675164,1046-8188,,ACM Trans.

ID-2102,inproceedings,User Feedback-based Online Learning for Intent Classification,"Intent classification is a key task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to infer the goal or intention behind a user’s query. Most existing intent classification methods rely on supervised deep models trained on large annotated datasets of text-intent pairs. However, obtaining such datasets is often expensive and impractical in real-world settings. Furthermore, supervised models may overfit or face distributional shifts when new intents, utterances, or data distributions emerge over time, requiring frequent retraining. Online learning methods based on user feedback can overcome this limitation, as they do not need access to intents while collecting data and adapting the model continuously. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-armed contextual bandit framework that leverages a text encoder based on a large language model (LLM) to extract the latent features of a given utterance and jointly learn multimodal representations of encoded text features and intents. Our framework consists of two stages: offline pretraining and online fine-tuning. In the offline stage, we train the policy on a small labeled dataset using a contextual bandit approach. In the online stage, we fine-tune the policy parameters using the REINFORCE algorithm with a user feedback-based objective, without relying on the true intents. We further introduce a sliding window strategy for simulating the retrieval of data samples during online training. This novel two-phase approach enables our method to efficiently adapt to dynamic user preferences and data distributions with improved performance. An extensive set of empirical studies indicate that our method significantly outperforms policies that omit either offline pretraining or online fine-tuning, while achieving competitive performance to a supervised benchmark trained on an order of magnitude larger labeled dataset.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3577190.3614137,3,,,,,,,Kaan Gönç and Baturay Sağlam and Onat Dalmaz and Tolga Çukur and Serdar Kozat and Hamdi Dibeklioglu,10.1145/3577190.3614137,,,,"Contextual Bandits,Intent Classification,Multimodal Learning,Online Learning",,,613-621,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3577190.3614137,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2103,inproceedings,Near-Real-Time Seismic Human Fatality Information Retrieval from Social Media with Few-Shot Large-Language Models,"Real-time disaster-induced human fatality information is critical for rapid and accurate disaster impact and loss estimation and effective emergency response. Systems like PAGER incorporate online reported death tolls and loss projection models trained on significant historical earthquake events and ground shaking data to provide projected final seismic loss estimations. However, the input reported death toll data are mainly retrieved from news platforms manually, which is time-consuming and may have a large time bias. In recent years, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have become hot spots for witness reporting and communication during disaster events, producing large volumes of immediate fatality information without the hindrances of official channels. Though lucrative, social media data is very noisy both in syntax and accuracy, necessitating robust solutions. In this work, we design and deploy a new online system that automatically extracts near-realtime multi-lingual human fatality information including death tolls and injury tolls, from a variety of information sources immediately after an earthquake occurs. Past studies have proposed to use popular machine learning methods such as SVMs, CNNs and Logistic Regression in conjunction with word embeddings to classify the relevancy of each social media message. However, these techniques suffer from impeding requirements of annotated data, which are unavailable at the onset of natural disasters, and cannot directly extract disaster information, instead relying on statistical analysis on their classification results. To address such challenges, we propose a Large Language Model-based approach that leverages its robust language understanding and few-shot learning abilities. In combination with our novel multilingual Hierarchical Event Classifier, another contribution, we achieve effective automatic earthquake casualty information retrieval from social media, which we test by deploying our framework to two recent earthquakes.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3560905.3568431,3,,,,,,,James Hou and Susu Xu,10.1145/3560905.3568431,,,,"earthquake,few-shot learning,large language models,near-realtime information retrieval,rapid disaster response",,,1141-1147,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3560905.3568431,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2104,inproceedings,LlmRe: A zero-shot entity relation extraction method based on the large language model,"Entity relation extraction aims to extract knowledge triples from unstructured or semi-structured text data and can be applied to various fields, including medicine, finance knowledge graph construction and intelligent question-answering. Traditional entity relation extraction requires a large amount of labeled data, consumes a lot of labor and time, and the trained model lacks generalization ability, which is difficult to migrate to other fields. Zero-shot entity relation extraction relieves the dependence on labeled data in traditional method. Based on unlabeled text data, zero-shot entity relation extraction has strong domain adaptability, which is a very challenging and practical task. Recent work on large language models shows that large models can effectively complete downstream tasks through natural language instructions and have good generalization ability. Inspired by this, we explore the use of large models for information extraction. Due to the randomness of large language model generation, we introduce in-context learning in entity relation extraction task to guide large language model to output data in a specified format to help obtain structured data. At the same time, we propose a three-stage extraction framework for decomposing entity relation extraction tasks, and each stage is conducted in the form of question and answer to reduce the complexity of extraction. We evaluated the knowledge triples extraction performance of the model on three self-built test datasets in different fields, and the experimental result showed that our proposed method achieved impressive performance in the zero-shot entity relation extraction task, surpassing the comparison model on multiple metrics, proving the effectiveness and domain adaptability of the proposed method.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3650400.3650478,3,,,,,,,Wei Zhao and Qinghui Chen and Junling You,10.1145/3650400.3650478,,,,,,,475-480,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3650400.3650478,2024,"New York, NY, USA",

ID-2106,inproceedings,Programming Assistant for Exception Handling with CodeBERT,"With practical code reuse, the code fragments from developers' forums often migrate to applications. Owing to the incomplete nature of such fragments, they often lack the details on exception handling. The adaptation for exception handling to the codebase is not trivial as developers must learn and memorize what API methods could cause exceptions and what exceptions need to be handled. We propose Neurex, an exception handling recommender that learns from complete code, and accepts a given Java code snippet and recommends 1) if a try-catch block is needed, 2) what statements need to be placed in a try block, and 3) what exception types need to be caught in the catch clause. Inspired by the sequence chunking techniques in natural language processing, we design Neurex via a multi-tasking model with the fine-tuning of the large language model CodeBERT for these three exception handling recommendation tasks. Via the large language model, Neurex can learn the surrounding context, leading to better learning the dependencies among the API elements, and the relations between the statements and the corresponding exception types needed to be handled.Our empirical evaluation shows that Neurex correctly performs all three exception handling recommendation tasks in 71.5% of the cases with a F1-score of 70.2%, which is a relative improvement of 166% over the baseline. It achieves high F1-score from 98.2%-99.7% in try-catch block necessity checking (a relative improvement of up to 55.9% over the baselines). It also correctly decides both the need for try-catch block(s) and the statements to be placed in try blocks with the F1-scores of 74.7% and 87.1% at the instance and statement levels, an improvement of 129.1% and 44.9% over the baseline, respectively. Our extrinsic evaluation shows that Neurex relatively improves over the baseline by 56.5% in F1-score for detecting exception-related bugs in incomplete Android code snippets.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3597503.3639188,3,,,,,,,Yuchen Cai and Aashish Yadavally and Abhishek Mishra and Genesis Montejo and Tien Nguyen,10.1145/3597503.3639188,,,,"AI4SE,automated exception handling,large language models",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3597503.3639188,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2107,inproceedings,SpecPIM: Accelerating Speculative Inference on PIM-Enabled System via Architecture-Dataflow Co-Exploration,"Generative large language models' (LLMs) inference suffers from inefficiency because of the token dependency brought by autoregressive decoding. Recently, speculative inference has been proposed to alleviate this problem, which introduces small language models to generate draft tokens and adopts the original large language model to conduct verification. Although speculative inference can enhance the efficiency of the decoding procedure, we find that it presents variable resource demands due to the distinct computation patterns of the models used in speculative inference. This variability impedes the full realization of speculative inference's acceleration potential in current systems.To tackle this problem, we propose SpecPIM to accelerate speculative inference on the PIM-enabled system. SpecPIM aims to boost the performance of speculative inference by extensively exploring the heterogeneity brought by both the algorithm and the architecture. To this end, we construct the architecture design space to satisfy each model's disparate resource demands and dedicate the dataflow design space to fully utilize the system's hardware resources. Based on the co-design space, we propose a design space exploration (DSE) framework to provide the optimal design under different target scenarios.

ID-2108,article,Self-supervised Text Style Transfer using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks,"Text Style Transfer (TST) is a relevant branch of natural language processing that aims to control the style attributes of a piece of text while preserving its original content. To address TST in the absence of parallel data, Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGANs) have recently emerged as promising solutions. Existing CycleGAN-based TST approaches suffer from the following limitations: (1) They apply self-supervision, based on the cycle-consistency principle, in the latent space. This approach turns out to be less robust to mixed-style inputs, i.e., when the source text is partly in the original and partly in the target style; (2) Generators and discriminators rely on recurrent networks, which are exposed to known issues with long-term text dependencies; (3) The target style is weakly enforced, as the discriminator distinguishes real from fake sentences without explicitly accounting for the generated text’s style. We propose a new CycleGAN-based TST approach that applies self-supervision directly at the sequence level to effectively handle mixed-style inputs and employs Transformers to leverage the attention mechanism for both text encoding and decoding. We also employ a pre-trained style classifier to guide the generation of text in the target style while maintaining the original content’s meaning. The experimental results achieved on the formality and sentiment transfer tasks show that our approach outperforms existing ones, both CycleGAN-based and not (including an open-source Large Language Model), on benchmark data and shows better robustness to mixed-style inputs.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3678179,3,,,,,,,Moreno La Quatra and Giuseppe Gallipoli and Luca Cagliero,10.1145/3678179,2157-6904,,ACM Trans.

As educators, we are just starting to grapple with the ramifications of this new technology, including implications for what we teach, how we teach, and how we grade. The decisions educators make moving forward depend heavily on the prevalence of students' use (and misuse) of ChatGPT in the classroom. Further, predictors of nefarious use could aid educators as well. We conducted an online survey to capture CS student awareness of, experience with, and attitudes toward ChatGPT. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that awareness of ChatGPT is generally high, and it is more frequently being used as a study tool than to complete students' work for them. Most students are aware of the potential for abuse in academic pursuits, but a notable minority of students admit to using it unscrupulously and to the potential for it to interfere with their learning.

ID-2110,inproceedings,Chain-of-Look Prompting for Verb-centric Surgical Triplet Recognition in Endoscopic Videos,"Surgical triplet recognition aims to recognize surgical activities as triplets (i.e.,&lt;instrument, verb, target &gt;), which provides fine-grained information essential for surgical scene understanding. Existing methods for surgical triplet recognition rely on compositional methods that recognize the instrument, verb, and target simultaneously. In contrast, our method, called chain-of-look prompting, casts the problem of surgical triplet recognition as visual prompt generation from large-scale vision-language (VL) models, and explicitly decomposes the task into a series of video reasoning processes. Chain-of-Look prompting is inspired by: (1) the chain-of-thought prompting in natural language processing, which divides a problem into a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps; (2) the inter-dependency between motion and visual appearance in the human vision system. Since surgical activities are conveyed by the actions of physicians, we regard the verbs as the carrier of semantics in surgical endoscopic videos. Additionally, we utilize the BioMed large language model to calibrate the generated visual prompt features for surgical scenarios.

The continuous stream of new content and users deems content-based recommendation strategies, based on similar-item retrieval, to remain popular. However, a persistent challenge is to select relevant features and corresponding similarity functions, and whether this depends on the specific context. We evaluated feature-specific similarity metrics using human similarity judgments across national and local news domains. We performed an online experiment (N = 141) where we asked participants to judge the similarity between pairs of randomly sampled news articles. We had three contributions: (1) comparing novel metrics based on large language models to ones traditionally used in news recommendations, (2) exploring differences in similarity judgments across national and local news domains, and (3) examining which content-based strategies were perceived as appropriate in the news domain. Our results showed that one of the novel large language model based metrics (SBERT) was highly correlated with human judgments, while there were only small, most non-significant differences across national and local news domains. Finally, we found that while it may be possible to automatically recommend similar news using feature-specific metrics, their representativeness and appropriateness varied.

Consequently, software engineers are adopting pre-trained models (PTMs) for their downstream applications. The dynamics of the PTM supply chain remain largely unexplored, signaling a clear need for structured datasets that document not only the metadata but also the subsequent applications of these models. Without such data, the MSR community cannot comprehensively understand the impact of PTM adoption and reuse.This paper presents the PeaTMOSS dataset, which comprises metadata for 281,638 PTMs and detailed snapshots for all PTMs with over 50 monthly downloads (14,296 PTMs), along with 28,575 open-source software repositories from GitHub that utilize these models. Additionally, the dataset includes 44,337 mappings from 15,129 downstream GitHub repositories to the 2,530 PTMs they use. To enhance the dataset's comprehensiveness, we developed prompts for a large language model to automatically extract model metadata, including the model's training datasets, parameters, and evaluation metrics. Our analysis of this dataset provides the first summary statistics for the PTM supply chain, showing the trend of PTM development and common shortcomings of PTM package documentation. Our example application reveals inconsistencies in software licenses across PTMs and their dependent projects.

ID-2113,inproceedings,Message Injection Attack on Rumor Detection under the Black-Box Evasion Setting Using Large Language Model,"Recent analyses have disclosed that existing rumor detection techniques, despite playing a pivotal role in countering the dissemination of misinformation on social media, are vulnerable to both white-box and surrogate-based black-box adversarial attacks. However, such attacks depend heavily on unrealistic assumptions, e.g., modifiable user data and white-box access to the rumor detection models, or appropriate selections of surrogate models, which are impractical in the real world. Thus, existing analyses fail to uncover the robustness of rumor detectors in practice. In this work, we take a further step towards the investigation about the robustness of existing rumor detection solutions. Specifically, we focus on the state-of-the-art rumor detectors, which leverage graph neural network based models to predict whether a post is rumor based on the Message Propagation Tree (MPT), a conversation tree with the post as its root and the replies to the post as the descendants of the root. We propose a novel black-box attack method, HMIA-LLM, against these rumor detectors, which uses the Large Language Model to generate malicious messages and inject them into the targeted MPTs. Our extensive evaluation conducted across three rumor detection datasets, four target rumor detectors, and three baselines for comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed attack method in compromising the performance of the state-of-the-art rumor detectors.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3589334.3648139,3,,,,,,,Yifeng Luo and Yupeng Li and Dacheng Wen and Liang Lan,10.1145/3589334.3648139,,,,"black-box evasion setting,graph neural networks,large language model,message injection attack,rumor detection",,,4512-4522,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3589334.3648139,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2114,inproceedings,Spatial-Temporal Embodied Carbon Models for the Embodied Carbon Accounting of Computer Systems,"Embodied carbon is the total amount of carbon released from the processes associated with a product from cradle to gate. In many industry sectors, embodied carbon dominates the overall carbon footprint. Embodied carbon accounting, i.e., to estimate the embodied carbon of a product, has become an important research topic. Existing studies derive the embodied carbon through life cycle analysis (LCA) reports. Current LCA reports only provide the carbon emission of a product class, e.g., 28nm CPU, yet a product instance can be manufactured from diverse regions and in diverse time periods, e.g., in the winter in Ireland (Intel). It is known that carbon emissions depend on the electricity generation process, which has spatial and temporal dynamics. Therefore, the embodied carbon of a specific product instance can largely differ from its product class. In this paper, we present new Spatial-Temporal Embodied Carbon (STEC) models for embodied carbon accounting. We observe significant differences between current embodied carbon models and STEC models, e.g., for 7nm CPU the difference can be 13.69%. We further examine the impact of STEC models on existing embodied carbon accounting schemes on key computer applications, such as Large Language Model (LLM) inference and LLM training. We observe that using STEC models leads to much greater differences in the embodied accounting of certain applications as compared to others (e.g., 32.26% vs. 6.35%). This is because the hardware requirements of certain applications allow for a wider range of hardware choices, while others have greater restrictions.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3632775.3661939,3,,,,,,,Xiaoyang Zhang and Yijie Yang and Dan Wang,10.1145/3632775.3661939,,,,"Carbon accounting,Computer architecture,Sustainable computing",,,464-471,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3632775.3661939,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2115,inproceedings,GPT Assisted Annotation of Rhetorical and Linguistic Features for Interpretable Propaganda Technique Detection in News Text.,"While the use of machine learning for the detection of propaganda techniques in text has garnered considerable attention, most approaches focus on ""black-box'' solutions with opaque inner workings. Interpretable approaches provide a solution, however, they depend on careful feature engineering and costly expert annotated data. Additionally, language features specific to propagandistic text are generally the focus of rhetoricians or linguists, and there is no data set labeled with such features suitable for machine learning. This study codifies 22 rhetorical and linguistic features identified in literature related to the language of persuasion for the purpose of annotating an existing data set labeled with propaganda techniques. To help human experts annotate natural language sentences with these features, RhetAnn, a web application, was specifically designed to minimize an otherwise considerable mental effort. Finally, a small set of annotated data was used to fine-tune GPT-3.5, a generative large language model (LLM), to annotate the remaining data while optimizing for financial cost and classification accuracy. This study demonstrates how combining a small number of human annotated examples with GPT can be an effective strategy for scaling the annotation process at a fraction of the cost of traditional annotation relying solely on human experts. The results are on par with the best performing model at the time of writing, namely GPT-4, at 10x less the cost. Our contribution is a set of features, their properties, definitions, and examples in a machine-readable format, along with the code for RhetAnn and the GPT prompts and fine-tuning procedures for advancing state-of-the-art interpretable propaganda technique detection.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3589335.3651909,3,,,,,,,Kyle Hamilton and Luca Longo and Bojan Bozic,10.1145/3589335.3651909,,,,"annotation,large language models,natural language processing,propaganda technique detection,rhetorical devices",,,1431-1440,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3589335.3651909,2024,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2116,inproceedings,BeamQA: Multi-hop Knowledge Graph Question Answering with Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction and Beam Search,"Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a task that aims to answer natural language queries by extracting facts from a knowledge graph. Current state-of-the-art techniques for KGQA rely on text-based information from graph entity and relations labels, as well as external textual corpora. By reasoning over multiple edges in the graph, these can accurately rank and return the most relevant entities. However, one of the limitations of these methods is that they cannot handle the inherent incompleteness of real-world knowledge graphs and may lead to inaccurate answers due to missing edges. To address this issue, recent advances in graph representation learning have led to the development of systems that can use link prediction techniques to handle missing edges probabilistically, allowing the system to reason with incomplete information. However, existing KGQA frameworks that use such techniques often depend on learning a transformation from the query representation to the graph embedding space, which requires access to a large training dataset. We present BeamQA, an approach that overcomes these limitations by combining a sequence-to-sequence prediction model with beam search execution in the embedding space. Our model uses a pre-trained large language model and synthetic question generation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BeamQA when compared to other KGQA methods on two knowledge graph question-answering datasets.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3539618.3591698,3,,,,,,,Farah Atif and Ola El Khatib and Djellel Difallah,10.1145/3539618.3591698,,,,"knowledge graphs,question answering",,,781-790,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3539618.3591698,2023,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2117,inproceedings,Overlap Communication with Dependent Computation via Decomposition in Large Deep Learning Models,"Large deep learning models have shown great potential with state-of-the-art results in many tasks. However, running these large models is quite challenging on an accelerator (GPU or TPU) because the on-device memory is too limited for the size of these models. Intra-layer model parallelism is an approach to address the issues by partitioning individual layers or operators across multiple devices in a distributed accelerator cluster. But, the data communications generated by intra-layer model parallelism can contribute to a significant proportion of the overall execution time and severely hurt the computational efficiency. As intra-layer model parallelism is critical to enable large deep learning models, this paper proposes a novel technique to effectively reduce its data communication overheads by overlapping communication with computation. With the proposed technique, an identified original communication collective is decomposed along with the dependent computation operation into a sequence of finer-grained operations. By creating more overlapping opportunities and executing the newly created, finer-grained communication and computation operations in parallel, it effectively hides the data transfer latency and achieves a better system utilization. Evaluated on TPU v4 Pods using different types of large models that have 10 billion to 1 trillion parameters, the proposed technique improves system throughput by 1.14 - 1.38x. The achieved highest peak FLOPS utilization is 72% on 1024 TPU chips with a large language model that has 500 billion parameters.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3567955.3567959,3,,,,,,,Shibo Wang and Jinliang Wei and Amit Sabne and Andy Davis and Berkin Ilbeyi and Blake Hechtman and Dehao Chen and Karthik Srinivasa Murthy and Marcello Maggioni and Qiao Zhang and Sameer Kumar and Tongfei Guo and Yuanzhong Xu and Zongwei Zhou,10.1145/3567955.3567959,,,,"Collective communication hiding,Compiler optimization,Large scale machine learning",,,93-106,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3567955.3567959,2022,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2118,inproceedings,Landmark-based user location inference in social media,"Location profiles of user accounts in social media can be utilized for various applications, such as disaster warnings and location-aware recommendations. In this paper, we propose a scheme to infer users' home locations in social media. A large portion of existing studies assume that connected users (i.e., friends) in social graphs are located in close proximity. Although this assumption holds for some fraction of connected pairs, sometimes connected pairs live far from each other. To address this issue, we introduce a novel concept of landmarks, which are defined as users with a lot of friends who live in a small region. Landmarks have desirable features to infer users' home locations such as providing strong clues and allowing the locations of numerous users to be inferred using a small number of landmarks. Based on this concept, we propose a landmark mixture model (LMM) to infer users' location. The experimental results using a large-scale Twitter dataset show that our method improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art method by about 27%.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/2512938.2512941,3,,,,,,,Yuto Yamaguchi and Toshiyuki Amagasa and Hiroyuki Kitagawa,10.1145/2512938.2512941,,,,"landmarks,location inference,social graphs,twitter,user profling",,,223-234,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/2512938.2512941,2013,"New York, NY, USA",
ID-2119,article,Online Algorithm for Differentially Private Genome-wide Association Studies,"Digitization of healthcare records contributed to a large volume of functional scientific data that can help researchers to understand the behaviour of many diseases. However, the privacy implications of this data, particularly genomics data, have surfaced recently as the collection, dissemination, and analysis of human genomics data is highly sensitive. There have been multiple privacy attacks relying on the uniqueness of the human genome that reveals a participant or a certain group’s presence in a dataset. Therefore, the current data sharing policies have ruled out any public dissemination and adopted precautionary measures prior to genomics data release, which hinders timely scientific innovation. In this article, we investigate an approach that only releases the statistics from genomic data rather than the whole dataset and propose a generalized Differentially Private mechanism for Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS). Our method provides a quantifiable privacy guarantee that adds noise to the intermediate outputs but ensures satisfactory accuracy of the private results. Furthermore, the proposed method offers multiple adjustable parameters that the data owners can set based on the optimal privacy requirements. These variables are presented as equalizers that balance between the privacy and utility of the GWAS. The method also incorporates Online Bin Packing technique [1], which further bounds the privacy loss linearly, growing according to the number of open bins and scales with the incoming queries. Finally, we implemented and benchmarked our approach using seven different GWAS studies to test the performance of the proposed methods. The experimental results demonstrate that for 1,000 arbitrary online queries, our algorithms are more than 80% accurate with reasonable privacy loss and exceed the state-of-the-art approaches on multiple studies (i.e., EigenStrat, LMM, TDT).",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3431504,3,,,,,,,Md Momin Al Aziz and Shahin Kamali and Noman Mohammed and Xiaoqian Jiang,10.1145/3431504,,2,ACM Trans.

ID-2120,article,A Classical Sequent Calculus with Dependent Types,"Dependent types are a key feature of the proof assistants based on the Curry-Howard isomorphism. It is well known that this correspondence can be extended to classical logic by enriching the language of proofs with control operators. However, they are known to misbehave in the presence of dependent types, unless dependencies are restricted to values. Moreover, while sequent calculi naturally support continuation-passing-style interpretations, there is no such presentation of a language with dependent types. The main achievement of this article is to give a sequent calculus presentation of a call-by-value language with a control operator and dependent types, and to justify its soundness through a continuation-passing-style translation.We start from the call-by-value version of the λμ˜μ-calculus. We design a minimal language with a value restriction and a type system that includes a list of explicit dependencies to maintain type safety. We then show how to relax the value restriction and introduce delimited continuations to directly prove the consistency by means of a continuation-passing-style translation.

ID-2121,inproceedings,Liberate Pseudo Labels from Over-Dependence: Label Information Migration on Sparsely Labeled Graphs,"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have made outstanding achievements in many tasks on graphs in recent years, but their success relies on sufficient training data. In practice, sparsely labeled graphs widely exist in the real world so self-training methods have become popular approaches by adding pseudo labeled nodes to enhance the performance of GCNs. However, we observe that most selected high-confidence pseudo labeled nodes by the existing methods would surround the true labeled nodes. It is what we called pseudo label over-dependence, which could lead to the non-uniform pseudo label distribution. Furthermore, a thorough experiment shows that the classification accuracy changes significantly under different label densities and the label-sparse regions show great potential improvement in the model performance. Based on the above findings, we theoretically analyze the constraint factors in the label-sparse regions and further propose reducing the feature distribution difference between the label-dense regions and label-sparse regions can effectively decrease the classification error. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel Graph Label Information Migration framework (GLIM) to liberate pseudo labels from over-dependence. Specifically, we first propose a training dynamics module (TDM) that uses abundant training process information to find more reliable node labels and improve the model robustness against label noise. Then we propose a label migration module (LMM) that migrates label information from label-dense regions to label-sparse regions by a spectral based graph matching algorithm. These migrated labels are like the glimmers in the darkness, providing the supervision signals for the unlabeled nodes in label-sparse regions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GLIM.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3583780.3614954,3,,,,,,,Zhihui Hu and Yao Fu and Hong Zhao and Xiaoyu Cai and Weihao Jiang and Shiliang Pu,10.1145/3583780.3614954,,,,"graph neural networks,pseudo label,self-training",,,833-842,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3583780.3614954,2023,"New York, NY, USA",

To understand the contextual factors surrounding how users produce and consume location-aware multimedia messaging (LMM), we use an experience-centered framework that makes explicit the different aspects of an experience. Using this framework, we conducted an exploratory, diary study aimed at eliciting implications for the study and design of LMM systems. In an earlier pilot study, we found that subjects did not have enough time to fully capture their everyday experiences using an LMM prototype, which led us to conduct a longer study using a multimodal diary method. The diary study data (verified for reliability using a categorization task) provided a closer look at the different aspects (spatiotemporal, social, affective, and cognitive) of people's experience. From the data, we derive three main findings (predominant LMM domains and tasks, capturing experience vs. experience of capture, context-dependent personalization) to inform the study and design of future LMM systems.",https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/1891903.1891933,3,,,,,,,Abdallah El Ali and Frank Nack and Lynda Hardman,10.1145/1891903.1891933,,,,"context-aware systems,contextual factors,experience-centered framework,location-aware multimedia messaging (LMM)",,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/1891903.1891933,2010,"New York, NY, USA",
